@Zomboy thanks for reaching out! we currently don't have a team member in Benelux but remote developer support is available. as Nima mentioned. Would be happy to hear more about the scope of your project to determine how we can be of help

Unfortunately not, NiMA reached out and mentioned it as well - the only challenge posted seems to be quite crowded, and the hackathon is the weekend before exam week for us, since we're still students 🙁  However we will be sure to stay in touch and keep up to date with all the fun events coming up. 

We're hoping to address the reproducibility crisis in ML/AI research by integrating decentralized tokenized data assets for researchers to build better datasets, while using decentralized computing networks to deploy models such that communities of researchers can see step-by-step how research was conducted, and can fork projects to reproduce results without having to interpret papers or recreate complex models from scratch.",,👌 (2),0.7652

Working on a white-paper of a multi-sided marketplace. 

I have been struggling between the 2 revenue models below for the platform:

1) Use a platform native token - I call it CTD- to settle all transactions in the platform. For instance, if investors wants to pay the tokenization fees of their assets to Appriasers they will need to use CTD. Investors if they wish to invest in a particular asset need to buy CTD and invest in the tokens of that asset, and obviously all assets on the platform will be denominated in CTD.  So no service fee charged for any service that the platform provides such as listing the asset tokens or their trading  -> instead gradual issuance and sales of CTD (increase in demand) and its value appreciation will fund the CAPEX and OPEX to run the platform [CTD will be listed on popular exchanges so they can be traded against other currencies]

Pro: lowers the barrier for entry + incentivize participation in network activities and maximum alignment for risks and rewards 

Con: Building a platform + a new currency (that can add liquidity challenge on top of platform building risks & since the CTD token value is not stable due to the price discovery through the supply and demand can make the volatile asset tokens more risky -dual volatility or the asset tokens + CTD) 

2) Do not use CTD as a settlement currency on the platform. Use DAI or a another stable-coin to settle all transactions in #1 -> instead charge service fees in DAI on all transactions to generate revenue -> issue CTD to the community (its now a revenue generating token) to fund CAPEX and OPEX

Pro: more liquidity as DAI and other stable-coins can be more popular and result it better network effect + laser focus on the platform development and the product market fit vs. doing both the currency and platform management at the same time

Con: Less incentive to invest in CTD (maybe?) as asset tokens are independent from transactions since u DAI is used for settlement",,🚀 (1),0.9786

(1) Though having a stable coin makes life easier in initial stages but you are essentially dependent on another coin which you have no say in. Your marketplace can suffer significantly is Maker community increase lending rates (meaning less DAI is available in the market and eventually your marketplace)
(2)  DAI is a stable coin, it wont appreciate inherently. its value is pegged to USD and it will always be that. So that limits the value capture that an internal token can have. (e.g) KNC, BNB etc. 
(3) Ocean Protocol provides all the benefits of first approach (internal currency with potential to appreciate significantly) + marketplace framework + dedicated tech and community support, like I am doing right now ;). All you need to do is just customise marketplace as per your needs and launch. Btw Ocean Protocol also have programs to help with funding if we see potential in your marketplace.",,,0.9576

@doink You can tweak Brizo (provider proxy) to stream data back to consumer via marketplace and marketplace will encode this data into video format (since the blob is video data) and then consumers will be able to watch videos as a way of consuming data.

@doink to download the data when purchased. Data providers doesn't need to worry about it. You can just go and store in whichever format you want. When someone buys it, Ocean will stream your data (if not private and you selected 'access' service ) back to buyer.

Ocean is a protocol and network on which data marketplaces can be built to unlock data for sharing and selling. It enables data to be shared. Most other projects are decentralized / centralized marketplaces or data brokers. Ocean is complementary to both centralized & decentralized marketplaces, because it provides an additional channel for the marketplaces to publish their services.

> 1. How is trust maintained in the marketplace?
> 2. Is the provider and marketplace component decentralized?
> 3. Do Keep Contracts basically do auditing and accounting of the data transcation and the players?
> 4. Metadata in data providers follow a key:value pair type storage or you can have a custom data storage for the metadata?
@doink 
1) Marketplace defers most hard lifting - payment, escrow, access control to Ocean Protocol. Only major initiative marketplace has to own is dispute resolution. Way they handle it conveys their trust provision.

2) Not in white label setup. But since most of the critical tasks are performed at the protocol level in a decentralised way, it is not critical to decentralise them. This was done to improve adoption amongst incumbent marketplaces and provider services.  But, if you choose to decentralise your provider component it is not too difficult.

3) Not only. Keepers are the core part of Ocean Protocol. They are the main component. Rest other components can be customised and modified as per your needs (this answers your Q5), all its needed that they communicate and interact with keeper contracts with defined interface. Apart from auditing and accounting, keepers handle access control, escrow, payments etc.

4) No. metadata is a part of overall DDO structure that every component understands. So, if you were to change it to another structure (what would you change it to?) you will have to define and implement that interface for other components as well (aquarius, brizo, squid etc.)

5) Answered in 3.

6) This will help you understand it better - https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/secret-store/",,,0.8789

2. storing the metadata happens in the metadata store, called Aquarius, essentially just a plain-old web 2.0 database (for now)

Deleting the asset via Aquarius API/squid-js removes it from the database so it will be not returned by marketplaces querying for assets on that Aquarius instance. So some transactions around that asset stay on-chain, but the actual metadata part, and the references to the file urls are just gone then",,,0.6757

correct. By default you would have used the burner wallet, but it should stay in `localStorage` in you browser between sessions, so you should still get the same wallet as you did when visiting commons the first time with same browser. You could then get the seed of that burner wallet to restore it anywhere else",,,0.4215

@peanutbutterandicecream via compute to data Ocean allows  data providers to bring compute to data without moving the data. This already resolves lots of compliance issues. But, Ocean is a generic protocol for generic data domain. Meaning it is data agnostic. Now if marketplaces and data providers deal with sensitive data and if they are based in a restricted zone then its upto marketplace to handle these regulatory compliances at higher levels (thats why you see 'Accept Cookies' etc options on web apps). It is extremely difficult if not impossible to bake custom regulatory compliances into the tech at L1 layer because either they are too many or they change frequently as law changes.",,,-0.359

Since Ocean Protocol is agnostic to the L1 layer, it can be deployed on Polkadot in the future.

@7ucky Hello, You can buy OCEAN tokens from any of the officially recognized exchanges like Bittrex, Kucoin, Uniswap, VCC and Gate.io.

@endro Hey Tom, Ocean has its own chain/network, it can be connected to any network. I'm not Web3 tech savvy and can't advise on how to bridge across networks in a decentralized fashion (i.e. co-existence), and I'm not aware if such bridge with Polkadot already exists, but fundamentally it can be done. If you have interest in building that bridge I'd say @Manan is the right go to person to talk to. This looks like a promising area of exploration to me",,👍 (1),0.9209

@Deleted User unless you are a stable coin, there is no incentive in pegging the token valuation to lower end.  Higher valuation funds Ocean Protocol's roadmap to few more years, helps general awareness around protocol, attracts more investors and builders to build on protocol, attracts more partners due to increased awareness, and all this drives adoption. So, yes better valuations are better for the whole ecosystem.",,👍 (1),0.9603

I emailed ocean protocol's team and I have yet to receive a response back. I need a way to get my WETH ($10k) and OCEAN ($10k) that are tied up in the pool that I can no longer remove. If anyone can help me at Ocean by responding to my email or just by giving me access to my money that would be greatly appreciated.

But it seems you do not have fully understood what a decentralized exchange and a Uniswap pool is, and that smart contracts can't be tricked. When adding liquidity to a pool you are GIVING AWAY your tokens. A liquidity pool is not meant for storing tokens like a wallet, because you do not control the pool and you cannot expect profit from it without acknowledging the higher risks to get them. A liquidity pool introduces a lot of risks compared to simply holding your tokens in a wallet you control, making it your responsibility to know when to move out your tokens. Which is why we communicated that fact extensively in the last months. In crypto, even more so in liquidity pool yield farming, there is no set-and-forget-about-it.

Technology-wise, the old contract has been paused, on the smart contract level. Meaning there simply is no way to move your tokens, or any other tokens under that contract anymore. There is no trick, no fallback, no hack we can activate, which is the whole point in a decentralized setup.

If you want fully matured and insured technology I suggest you look into established and centralized financial instruments, like stocks.",,,-0.4098

When did you actually update the page with the new token address? Incidentally, on uniswap the new token has not got an icon yet...it is still with the old one. Couldn't you have worked this out before?

I'm going on a bit, I know, but it doesn't seem like it was properly done as you would know already if there was liquidity etc and maybe should have not paused the old contract if some users had large amounts in there that weren't recoverable....then later you say they were and 'we always have a plan'.

> Even the link you gave did not have the new address while the token swap was happening!!!
yes of course. The new address could only be exposed once all swaps completed and everybody had their new tokens. Otherwise people early in the swap batch would have had an advantage over those not having received them yet. And it all took around 5 hours to complete. Right after the completion we updated all our messaging and started contacting exchanges and such with the new token contract. 

> btw why does there still seem to be 30ETH of liquidity in the old pool and why does uniswap still let you add liquidity??
Uniswap does not let you add liqudity to the pool with the old token since the moment we paused the old contract, which happened right before we started the swap. Every interaction with that pool failed from the moment on we paused the contract. Technically yes, all old contract tokens locked in a liquidity pool are lost. But of course we have a plan in place when liquidity providers can proof to us their tokens are locked. 

> When did you actually update the page with the new token address? 
At the exact time the swap completed and 99.999999% of accounts had their tokens. Same time as releasing the blog post, although we had a small deployment hickup resulting in a 4 min. delay between site & blog.

> Incidentally, on uniswap the new token has not got an icon yet...it is still with the old one. Couldn't you have worked this out before?
No, because the new contract address was needed first, which was only created when the swap started. The rest is up to other projects and their development/deployment processes.

HOTBIT Support 
Hello,

The smart contract address is different from the deposit address, your deposit address is correct, but the contract address is wrong. In other words, you deposited a token that is not listed on Hotbit

Thanks

Hi,
During your deposit process, please do carefully verify and confirm your deposit address and the type of token you intend to deposit (due to the fact that there are many types of ERC 20 tokens, it is possible that different types of ERC 20 tokens may share the same abbreviation while their full titles may be different from each other) if you deposit your tokens into the wrong address, it is very likely that your tokens will not be retrieved.
Hotbit is not responsible for helping our users to retrieve all mistakenly deposited tokens. However, in order to help our users to retrieve all serious loss caused by their misoperation, we will still try our best to retrieve all tokens that are mistakenly deposited by our users. Please read all following information carefully and wait patiently:
1. bla bla bla 
2. bla bla bla

It might take three to six months to retrieve your assets. Please do be patient.
3. Due to the strict risk control verification process, you need to pay 0.3 ETH by original sending address that you transferred this transaction mistakenly to switch back the coins. The transerred address is 0x5c0e7D5D2c3f244083eA00a8c6b17c42120ac632 and then send TXID to us so that we can check it for you. Attention please: Due to the strict risk control verification process, we can only send your assets back to your original sending address later.

With best regards,

Ronald

@Deleted User Ocean provides tools to help with regulations like GDPR. How marketplaces use these tools is upto them. Meaning correct implementation with proper process can ensure compliance but Ocean do not dictate how they should implement those processes. Each geography has different compliance requirements and so Ocean is process-agnostic. Every marketplace in any geography can use Ocean and apply process that makes them complaint to their particular region.",,,0.6608

@Manan 

@Robin | DataUnion 

Well if you just look at uniqueness then go for it. I could add one dot to your logo and be unique, too:-)

I would rather look into the Appearance of similarities.  If I am telling you that they look irritating, then there is no discussion that thousands others are also thinking the same.

Distinguishing in marketing does not mean uniqueness. It means different to a degree where it would not even appear similar. To much is similar. Black background. White dots. Size of dots. Number of dots. Density of dots. Only the directions are different.

You could become a big project, you want to be recognized in all search engines and platforms by your logo...

As of right now, only OCEAN is used and accepted for transactions within Ocean Protocol. You are free to fork it and add whatever you want though.

> And i read above that confidential information is not protected on the network? If so, why not?
Not sure what exactly you mean by that but Ocean Protocol does not store data so storing data in a secure way is the responsibility of a publisher. The marketplace and Ocean Protocol only store an encrypted reference to that data file. Within Ocean Protocol the only way to decrypt that URL is via a Web3 transaction based on the conditions set by publisher. Not even marketplace owners can decrypt that URL without meeting conditions.",,,0.8043

@doink Actors of a data marketplace are data consumer, data providers and compute providers ( algo/workflows suppliers ).  In a logistic marketplace you can have different companies that leveraging the incentives to provide access data.

@Ashish dexFreight is simplifying logistics with a decentralized platform for freight brokers, shippers and carriers to handle shipments from booking to payment in one place. dexFreight is building a universal decentralized, open-source network that enables collaboration and facilitates the coordination of movement of goods while bringing liquidity to the supply chain.

Within Ocean Protocol the only way to decrypt that URL is via a Web3 transaction based on the conditions set by publisher. Not even marketplace owners can decrypt that URL without meeting conditions.
@Matthias 

Makes totally sense that OCEAN is used as ecosystem token for data exchanges.  There would be chaos otherwise with hundreds of different ways. Needs to be consistent one standard token. And it should be the token of the protocol which makes sense.",,💯 (1),-0.1484

Hi, Ethereum is getting really burednsome. high congestions, high fees, slow transactions. It will get worse because everyone is loading everything onto Eth.

I am worried about Ocean as you are running on Eth. It would be a thing if you were just some small defi project or a simple dapp .But you are collaborating with some of the world's leading corporations and your use cases regarding Big Data require highest scalability by-design.

there are layer 2 or 3 solutions but the more dependencies the more error potentials.

Is there any brainstorming going on with your foundation to add a more scalable protocol layer?


Ben from SingularityNet also mentioned in a podcast that for Future use cases, Eth will clearly not be sufficient in terms of required scalability and complexity. And the are researching for new protocol layers. And AGI has similar use cases like Ocean.

If yes, I would suggest you take a look at the Californian Protocol called **Lamden**:
their CTO: twitter.com/JeffWScott
General: twitter.com/LamdenTau


You are the experts, I am sure you can chat with them and decide if it makes sense for you to use their protocol. But just to list you some of their features:

- fully build from scratch in Python, supporting all Python libraries (testing, ML)- Python has the largest dev community in the world of business for big data,ML&AI - the key use cases for Ocean. 

- They have sub-second (400ms) block time and txs finality 
-Scales easily per CPU CORE (4k tps/core): 32k tps with 8 cores, etc. 
- interoperable on layer 1, full bridges to Eth & other chains. Atomic Triggers &transactions. Could be interesting as you are agnostic 

- write contracts in any language
- They say entire multiplayer games run on their blockchain, all on layer 1, as proof of scalability

I am not an expert but thought to make you aware and you get in touch with their team to understand more 

Much success to you",,,0.9735

@Manan  appreciate you.

And advise from an outsider: there should be some hard facts to screen the available protocols. For example if a protocol states on their website that they are capable of 100 tps. Then clearly it should not be in your short list. But as soon as you have screened some very scalable ones (and all other criteria you look for);

 just go and USE their protocols. Not only brainstorm theoretically, just test it plug into their layer and start doing what you do. Best way of finding out which one fits your needs the best. You can chat and read all you want, at the end you should plug into it and test for yourself. Quick and easy, one protocol per week 😄 And hope Lamden will deserve a test round, too since they scale linearly per CPU Core (4k tps per core, 32k tps with 8 cores, etc. you get the picture...)  good luck!",,,0.9918

you had such a great idea to provide a easy to use UI/UX for storing data/files securely by IPFS.  Even published a first MVP. Like a dropbox alternative for everyone to use. What happened to this idea, still going on? Could you link that storage to your OCEAN token, in this sense for example: It is required to Stake some amount of Oceans and while you are staking you are free to use the storage. A link with the token (=UTILITY token) would be good imo.  

 There is not one user friendly and secure alternative until now for everyday users who want to depart from Dropbox but are still waiting. Filecoin is not even launched after 4 years. Not much providers in this space. It would be great addition to your data centric vision.

When can we expect a full workable file storage with a nice UI/UX?",,,0.9672

@Manan Don't forget Lamden to test it, too please, be open minded, *at least test their tech to know for sure how it performs*.. 

> this decision will be shaping your platform for many years to come, **test thoroughly**:D 

Python community stands behind Lamden, number 1 language for big data/AI/ML used in all corporations. they worked 3 years in complete stealth mode on their protocol and mainnet went live recently. 

Very few provide such Layer 1 scalability (without any dependencies): sub-second tx finality (400ms), tps scale by number of cpu cores, very straightforward. 4,000 tps per core. 16 cores = 64,000tps. Fully interoperable with multiple chains by design. 


Most importantly security and easiness: Full support of all python libraries, testing suites. Security is all about continous testing and clear code writing.

And it is amendable (think Tezos), governance by design the protocol can be proposed and voted on. This way you stay always ahead of the game and always adapt to the state of the art technology at any given time. Future proof. 

Best of luck:)

@anu Yes I think several have used it.

And in my view it **is ok** that they use it. Because it is there. Why not?  Right now it helps everyone. 

But the thing is, going into the future this should be very much dealt with, it cannot be acceptable that a developer can push the stop button of a supposedly **immutable** blockchian protocol that is used by popular corporations and thousands individuals in the world.",,,0.7761

@Deleted User Its acceptable to me because people keep their tokens on CENTRALIZED EXCHANGES. Its acceptable because we DONT need another $21M of stolen Ocean tokens being sold back to exchanges. A lot of the decentralized chains have this or similar functionality to protect holders, and i wish ALL of them did after watching this happen, to protect us from lousy and sloppy smart contracts and security holes left open by centralized exchanges. Thank you, Ocean team! Awesome Job!!! If everyone stopped using CEX's or at least stopped storing your assets there, this wouldnt have been an issue in the first place. So, stop complaining about them protecting your cash in what you call a ""centralized"" fashion, when you MOST LIKELY use a CENTRALIZED exchange and hold MOST your assets there to begin with!

But full decentralization is a journey and pretty much no project is there yet. In our view the way to get there is to remove more and more centralized elements and replace them with decentralized solutions. We had decided to have only this one ""kill switch"" in our contract for situations like this. You rightfully noticed that many projects have that pause method too, but the important thing to look out for is how the governance around executing that method is organized. In our case no single team member can execute that method, it is protected with multi-sig accounts in possession of the Ocean Protocol Foundation board members. Only the foundation can decide on and initiate that method, and multiple persons have to agree with their wallets. That is a compromise on the way to full decentralization",,,0.8115

But full decentralization is a journey and pretty much no project is there yet. In our view the way to get there is to remove more and more centralized elements and replace them with decentralized solutions. We had decided to have only this one ""kill switch"" in our contract for situations like this. You rightfully noticed that many projects have that pause method too, but the important thing to look out for is how the governance around executing that method is organized. In our case no single team member can execute that method, it is protected with multi-sig accounts in possession of the Ocean Protocol Foundation board members. Only the foundation can decide on and initiate that method, and multiple persons have to agree with their wallets. That is a compromise on the way to full decentralization
@Matthias 

""no single team member can execute that method"" ""board members.""

Are you not watching mainstream media and all the corruption cases in BIG corporations with much BIGGER BOARDS than Ocean COLLUDING and maliciously acting on regular basis?  

And you give ""board members"" as re-assurance for a 50 employee company? Come one you can do better, not repeat the failed systems of current centralized governance models.

 Having said that, I very much like your proposed solution and also wanted to suggest something like that. A decentralized DAO GOVERNANCE layer:-)

> "" shifting its control mechanism might be. We are setting the project on a path where the decision over executing a contract pause, or to not have it in the first place, should not be decided by the team or foundation, but by the community.""

Thank you and looking forward to observing how you shift control in the future. please do work on that diligently, when you look at the market you will realize nothing is worth it without real secure Governance by the community (or relevant stakeholders)..",,,0.9663

You will have so many corporate users.  Do you think they would feel comfortable by knowing your board has the keys to interrupt or stop their business operations?

@Sarah (Sweet Chilli) A datatoken is an ERC20 token corresponding to a dataset. It has several purposes:
- it can be used to access the data
- it can be used to trade via a liquidity pool to buy or sell it
- it can be used to provide liquidity/stake to a liquidity pool
- more uses could be added in the future
When V3 will be released the liquidity pools will be on Balancer and the pools will be composed of OCEAN tokens and datatokens.",,👍 (2),-0.448

@Mattt When the data is bought a fee is subtracted that is rewarded to the liquidity providers, the marketplace and the Ocean community. This is normally 0.3% like in Uniswap. But can be adjusted when the pool is created.

So yes, you're getting the swap fees but as the liquidity leaves the pool the number of OCEAN tokens (total including data token conversion) goes down relative to that decrease in liquidity. So you should really be mindful of the pools you're staking in from the standpoint of ""Do I think this data is valuable and wanted by the market"" ""How long do I think this data will be valuable for?"" or else you could be left in a pool where liquidity has exited and the once gain in OCEAN you had is gone.",,,0.9571

@Crypto Rootz I hate that page 🙂 The lists are fetched directly from chain and this gets more expensive the more  transactions there are, which is why we banned those expensive calls onto its own page in the first place.

@Matthias  
It’s a little misleading though to call this staking since no staking is involved. You are not growing your coins when you pool your tokens into a data set because of  Proof of Stake, you’re growing them at the expense of people who come late to the pool. In short, it’s a ponzi or pyramid scheme. You should call it as such instead.",,,0.7749

@GME Moon Mission I wouldn't call it misleading. Look at the facts - Ocean Protocol is not a layer-1 proof of stake protocol liek EOS or likewise and we dont claim that at all. Staking is a common lingo in Defi space (e.g.) 0x, synthetix and other's use the same phrasing. Even Aave calls the migration portal from LEND to AAVE tokens as ""Staking"".  If we talk about Ocean, our original intention was and still is - LPs will stake (provide liquidity) on the valuable datasets thereby helping the market curate most interesting datasets. Now, people use crypto platforms the way they want and not always the way they were designed to. And that itself is leaning towards product-market fit (and thats whats happening in Ocean Market right now). So, to make the point whatever we call it staking or not, people will use it the way they want to use it. And calling it a ponzi scheme is bit exaggeration because what you see today in Ocean Market is how world's financial markets (stocks, bonds, forex etc.) works. There is always risks involved. And we try to make it very clear when someone tries stake on a dataset. And most of them are aware of the risks they are taking.",,💯 (2),0.6526

@Deleted User usually compute providers will share sample data. And you would adjust your algo to train on that format and params.

Look at the facts - Ocean Protocol is not a layer-1 proof of stake protocol liek EOS or likewise and we dont claim that at all. Staking is a common lingo in Defi space (e.g.) 0x, synthetix and other's use the same phrasing. Even Aave calls the migration portal from LEND to AAVE tokens as ""Staking"".  If we talk about Ocean, our original intention was and still is - LPs will stake (provide liquidity) on the valuable datasets thereby helping the market curate most interesting datasets. Now, people use crypto platforms the way they want and not always the way they were designed to. And that itself is leaning towards product-market fit (and thats whats happening in Ocean Market right now). So, to make the point whatever we call it staking or not, people will use it the way they want to use it. And calling it a ponzi scheme is bit exaggeration because what you see today in Ocean Market is how world's financial markets (stocks, bonds, forex etc.) works. There is always risks involved. And we try to make it very clear when someone tries stake on a dataset. And most of them are aware of the risks they are taking.
@Manan Pray do tell for what reason bacteria data should be priced at $500 when this can be had for free at universities and the internet? No matter how much you try to wrap up pyramiding and ponzi schemes in fancy terms, it's still pyramiding and ponzi schemes.",,,0.9527

@tarunk99 only the wallet address that paid datatoken gets the access. This access is not transferable. Current implementation of Ocean Provider gives permanent access once bought but your custom provider can give limited time access as well. And when you transfer datatoken you get the access. 

Its like -if I bought Netflix coupon for  1 month subscription from any supermarket, but that subscription will not be activated before I redeem that coupon. So, once I activate subscription my coupon becomes invalid. 
Here, 
subscription = dataset
coupon = datatoken
Netflix = provider",,,0.6007

I've not yet quite understood the concept of buying and consuming data. 
Does it mean, at first I buy 1 token and I'll be granted exactly 1 download? 

Is it possible to sell a dynamic database, where each call needs a datatoken? 

Furthermore, the high transaction fees on Ethereum still discourage me to use the system. Are you working on something else? Sidechains, etc.?

The project itself is open source, and was created in a way so that it would be easily extendable for developers. 
We have added a module system so that new integrations and functionalities can be added. For example, we have created a Slate (a Filecoin frontend) module whose functionality can be enabled and disabled.
The extension is still being reviewed by google, but you can still unpack the builds from GitHub and test it as is. It's still in an alpha stage, but the provided builds are quite usable.
Any feedback or requests for functionality is welcome! :)

In case of the fixed price you set the price.
In case of the liquidity pool you provide an initial liquidity which will set the initial price but other parties can then add liquidity to change it. Over time this provides a price signal of the dataset.
It is not random but noisy - which means that the price can vary drastically over time but at some point it will become more stable.
Your initial liquidity is not affected by the additions and removal of other liquidity - it is safe. But you can set a swap fee and benefit from sales, swaps, liquidity provisioning etc.

If you want to try it out to get some practical experience you can try e.g. the Ropsten Ethereum testnetwork.",,👍 (1),0.9554

Since we had a little bit of extra time on our hands, we decided to make a few extra videos and modules for it. We created videos for the three modules that comes with the project: 1inch alerts, Ocean Pools, and Slate integration. Here are the videos for each.
Slate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oWWNcTAqcA
1inch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rJkTcA2L0U
Balancer Pools: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAB0p2laMGw
Check out the project on github, we made the modules so that anyone could expand off of it while retaining the base functionality.

The APY for the datasets on the marketplace is unknown at the moment and there is not too much traffic so it is more speculation than farming. Farming rewards will be enabled later.
Bancor has impermanent loss protection which kicks in after 100 days so this is a long time option.

It costs Gas to create your own dataset.
You can try it out on Rinkeby without any real assets - that is an Ethereum testnet and you can get free Ocean tokens and Ethereum on it. Google for Ethereum faucet and Ocean faucet. They give you free tokens on the testnet Rinkeby.
Check out this video by the team on how to use the marketplace to publish data:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiDg0ry6oV4

Regarding your criticism about the usability - so far 278 datasets have been published. It must be reasonably easy or that would not have happened.

The protocol is based on Ethereum and it is necessary to pay Gas to interact with it. Ethereum is at its all time high right now so Gas prices are very high.

1.) The current market lacks scalability for large expensive dataset. With 70/30 the amount of ocean required for the initial liquidity is simply too much. Splitting up the datasets into many smaller doesn't solve the problem as X + gas < n * ( X / n + gas) .  I made a proposal on github for ""spliced datasets"" that could be a solution to the problem.
https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/issues/379
2.) Datasets published before the pump have now increased in value but also the price per Token is now 3x higher than before. That will prevent sales. The problem will (hopefully) increase over time.
3.) Whats currently missing in the market is the buy/consume side. To attract real consumers to the market I would consider vouchers for potential consumers to spend on datasets for a limited time. e.g. 2000 Ocean to spend on data within 24h. 
4.) Hard locking initial liquidity for limited period would dramatically reduce rug pull incentive. This could be combined with lower pool ratios: e.g. 3 month hard lock => 50/50, 9 Month 30/70, 12 month 10/90",,,0.7465

You can do all of that but you have to use the Python or JavaScript library to do so. There you can choose any split.
The change towards this in the UI was made as other splits were enabling rug pulls as they required very little initial Ocean staked by the creator and increased the value of the datatokens dramatically. This enabled the creators to rug pull stakers easily.

You might be happy to hear that the roadmap does indeed address the issues you raise. I'll go through them one-by-one here.

> (1) The current market lacks scalability for large expensive dataset. [Created issue https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/issues/379] 

There seem to be two separate concerns. (1) Unclear how to handle super-large dataset with many files (2) Concern of high initial liquidity needs for valuable dataset. I responded thoroughly in the github issue created. https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/issues/379#issuecomment-780686815. Let's do further iterations there.

> (2) Datasets published before the pump have now increased in value but also the price per Token is now 3x higher than before. That will prevent sales. The problem will (hopefully) increase over time.

Note that is something that people can arb for, based on what they think the value is denominated in. Just like in any other AMMS in Uniswap, Balancer, etc. 

However we can soften this to reduce the effects of impermanent loss, by ""OCEAN-backed stablecoin in Market"". That's targeted for Q2.

Finally, ""Better Staking"" (Q4) will decouple amount of stake from price. 

> (3) Whats currently missing in the market is the buy/consume side. To attract real consumers to the market I would consider vouchers for potential consumers to spend on datasets for a limited time. e.g. 2000 Ocean to spend on data within 24h.

Agreed in this goal. ""Data Farming"" (Q2) will bring an extra layer of incentives for people to supply / consume data.",,,0.9509

Agreed, this helps. ""Better Staking"" (Q4) includes vesting periods on datatokens.

(a) Compute-to-data where the ""compute"" is selection of the subset of data. How to price: if you have S / M / L selection sizes, then have one AMM for each selection size. You could use this approach in your DataUnion app. Or Ocean Market might support it when it fully supports Compute-to-Data, though this looks like an extra feature on top so it could be a while.

(b) Have a different datatoken for each of the 1000+ files; then make a ""basket"" token to bundle them together, using eg Set Protocol, Balancer (v2 for >8 tokens), or ERC998. One question is how to price. One way is to have an AMM for each base item; arbitrage bots will keep prices fairly balanced. Another way is to have fixed price on each base item. A second question is what's the best way to bundle; different things would need to be tried. A third Q is how to have those bundles in Ocean Market or otherwise; Ocean Market will evolve that way starting with "">1 pool per datatoken"", but this could extend.",,,0.8441

But different algorithms will have different runtimes on GPUs - so they will also cost different amounts of money for the hardware platform.
If we do baskets here e.g. 1 GPU hours and 1000 images would be basket A, then 10 GPU hours and 10.000 images would be basket B etc.

Then this would not really be a good experience for the buyers - at least how I would feel as a buyer.
My thoughts from a customer point of view: 
* Cloud platforms like AWS or Azure allow renting and payment of resources in seconds and they expect us to use something similar. So why does it have to be so non granular in pricing?
* I want to train on 2843 images but why do I pay the same as to train on 9999 images?

I want to benchmark the white listed algorithms and then offer precise costs for them so people only pay for what they consume.
For the data that will be consumed in addition to that I can track the cost for it as we produce that ourself.

And I think this is a way to do that which other companies/projects also want to follow.

""arbitrary"" is a synonym for ""unlimited complexity""
Human capability to deal with complexity is very limited and human and artificial intelligence is fundamentally different.  What is going to happen if the number of labels is growing in an uncontrolled fashion is that there is no consistency between labels and image content. That will have a significant negative impact on AI and therefore on the value of the dataset. Inconsistent and low quality datasets are still the norm today.
In order to create and *maintain* a dataset of high value it is imo mandatory to have a fabric that links labels to image content from an AI and *not* a human perspective. To prevent introducing human perception bias into the data I highly recommend to have this in place before starting.",,,0.5267

Just the labels are an issue: There are 13 synonyms for ""women"". Now multiply that with all languages and arbitrary list of labels. 
But the main differentiator is that human perception is context and expectation driven and hence very subjective. AI perception is mostly independent from context and hence objective.  In the example below example you see a classic example of ""human bias"". Based on context a human claims a grey blob on a pedestrian bridge to be a human. For AI it is grey blob like thousand other grey blobs in a multidimensional vector. If you now label this grey blob ""Human"" AI will try to separate this grey blob from all the other grey blobs which is in fact impossible without full understanding of the image context.

But it is not necessary to request the annotators or validators to focus on all the details of a picture but rather one class at a time. 
As my background in the annotation business comes from years in the automotive industry the focus for us is to create a baseline of images that enable us to train specific algorithms and then use these algorithms to prelabel images. It is not necessary to create one algorithm that can detect all classes but rather multiple algorithms that detect a subset of classes. Humans then act as a quality controller and verifier of the algorithms predictions.

This enables us to create arbitrary classes without exposing the individual contributors to a level of complexity where they cannot deliver good results anymore. So after the initial annotation phase we can switch into that mode.

So you have to take care that it stays stable. For my project I have my own server and can provide a stable URL because of that. A VM in the cloud costs about 5$ per month which could host your 11 GB and would have stable IP that you can link to for your dataset.
Other people are using Google but that might also cost you.
In the end the most important feature you are looking for is an URL that stays constant for as long as you sell the dataset.

But are these crypto related PDFs your intellectual property? If they were sold by someone else you have to be careful not to violate any laws.",,,0.9463

I think one key missing thing is a specification for composibility in which a compiled dataset is composed of subdatasets. For example, in human subjects research we would like to respect self sovereignty of individuals composing a full population dataset. You could mint individual tokens for each person and compose into a larger dataset which streams revenue to the individuals or you could define a new specification with embedded DIDs.. Or maybe something else? The main issue I'm trying to communicate is that the data uploader is not always the rightful recipient of the entirety of proceeds generated by the dataset. There needs to be a way to inherit properties of ownership.",,,0.8313

Ok, we have the same issue with DataUnion.app - so here is my take on this:
We are doing that management for the users at the moment. So we are building a database where we store which user contributed to which data and if the dataset is sold we distribute this to the users accounts in the database and if they reach a threshold they can withdraw that amount from our website (Gas costs are tough).

Optimally you would do this with a smart contract and having that data on decentralised storage. But then all of these small interactions would result in transactions and state changes on the blockchain - that would cost a ton of Gas in the current state of Ethereum. That is also why we do it in a Web 2.0/database kind of way.

We are open sourcing our solution and could offer you more insights when it is finished. It might be a good starting point for you as well.

If you want to formalise these concepts on some slides adapted to your use case and show the different approaches to your target audience we can also have a call to talk about it in more details.",,,0.9318

I believed that Ocean allows data sales without losing control over the IP on the data - this is especially useful for machine learning/AI tasks. The algorithms can train a model on data without the data leaving the owners premesis. This enables data usage that was not possible before e.g. for medical data.

Additionally it also enables the creation of datatokens and liquidity pools for datasets which allow for price discovery, curation and reputation of datasets. High quality datasets will have different setups of their datatokens than unsuccessful ones.

You can see very different datatoken models evolving already on the marketplace - there are datasets that are more like startups where the infrastructure and data is being created for the dataset after the initial offering, there are tooling and statistic datasets but also datasets by companies that have created them for other purposes and are now selling them on the Ocean marketplace. Those will for sure not be the only types of data that will be offered.

port.oceanprotocol.com and then a round of voting is taking place here: vote.oceanprotocol.com
After that the winning proposals get 10.000 $OCEAN tokens each. This happens once per month. In the first round there were 5 proposals that got grants, in the second 9 and in the last one this month 12 proposals.

But the team also spends tokens for other programs like the Ambassador program (around 6000 tokens per month) and the Shipyard program (not sure how much is spent there).

The network rewards schedule is not in full force now. The OceanDAO is acting as the first step in that direction but the token distribution is now very controlled and not too many tokens are issued per month.",,,0.9331

There is a fixed supply that is released over time until the year 2050 to enable projects/proposals to further push the ecosystem. Until then the Web3 sustainability loop will kick in and the whole system can carry itself. So then the data marketplaces will pay fees of their usage to the OceanDAO funds which are then again distributed to the ecosystem etc.
There is also a bit of burning happening in between. The article I linked regarding the Web3 sustainability loop is a description of the goal system in the future.",,,-0.3818

One of our partners has an enormous scientific database that he will share with us. Are there any benefits to putting that on Ocean even if we would be the only ones staking the dataset for our product launching endeavors? Is it possible to restrict the use of the dataset once it is up and running? The other is a group of 500+ dna kits that are a match to each other. It's a group I manage. I see how possibly we could create a form that pulls the dna into reports for  the relevant gene novo markers that influence inflammation, and  other biological processes our wellness ingredients modulate. Not sure how this would work. Maybe more in the category of added value? Last question is how does machine learning work? I know it's something I should google. Would we need to build something on top that uses A.I to more readily find the patterns we are looking for?

Instead researchers and buyers of the dataset can run algorithms on the data without exposing the data itself. So this enables you to drastically restrict the use of the dataset.

AI can create insights for you but this does not happen automatically. You still have to do something to get the results that you want. If you find someone to do the AI engineering for you then this would be possible via this way of sharing the data.
But these AI services are not included just by sharing the data.",,,0.8752

There are projects that can help you with hosting the dataset as well as consult you on the application of algorithms to it.
This is an agency that is working with companies to publish datasets on the marketplace. They already host some datasets and can give you insights from their personal experience. Additionally they are running an analytics dataset on top of the marketplace so they have insights into what is going on. I think it would be a good idea to connect to them:

https://github.com/OpenMRBenelux/openmrb2021-hackathon/issues/5

neuroscientists will be *very well* represented but it would be great to have some other folks interested in the overlap between web3, compute2data, distributed cloud services, and mad neuroscience 🧪 

give this a thumbs up if you're considering attending, and i'll submit an ""unconference"" to the hack-a-thon to do a web3/ocean seminar and help break the ice a little bit 🧊

PRODUCT | Compute-to-Data has landed in #OceanMarket! It enables buying & selling of private data while preserving privacy.
CtD resolves the tradeoff between the benefits of using private data & the risks of exposing it.
Full overview: https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/compute-to-data-is-now-available-in-ocean-market-58868be52ef7
#TheYearOfScaling

""With Compute-to-Data, data never leaves its owner’s premises.

• Data owners can monetize data while preserving privacy & control
• Yet data buyers can create value from it with analytics, AI modeling & more

🌊 All via the Ocean Market interface. Try it:
https://market.oceanprotocol.com""

""CtD benefits AI practitioners:
• They can access valuable, private data that was previously unavailable, which can lead to more accurate AI models. And w/o liability – they don’t see the data.
• They can also publish & monetize their algorithms. These can even stay private (!)""

""Businesses and entrepreneurs can quickly launch their own Ocean-powered data marketplace for their vertical. 

Ocean Compute-to-Data helps them further preserve their sellers’ privacy, and support more compute & AI flows.""

""Here’s a technical overview of Ocean Compute-to-Data:
https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/compute-to-data

And here’s how to write algorithms for it:
https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/compute-to-data-algorithms/""

""CtD in Ocean Market is a major milestone in our 2021 roadmap & a big step towards our vision of data as a new asset class📍

https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/roadmap

We invite you to try out CtD, to explore, to stress-test, and to tell us how it goes! We welcome all feedback 💬""",,"👍🏼 (13),👍 (8),🥳 (12),🌊 (12),🔥 (4),🚀 (8),🧜‍♀️ (4),🍻 (3),3lmac (1)",0.9673

> Ocean Protocol is a blockchain-based ecosystem that allows individuals and businesses to easily unlock the value of their data and monetize it through the use of ERC-20 based datatokens.
> 
> Through Ocean Protocol, publishers can monetize their data while preserving privacy and control, whereas consumers can now access datasets that were previously unavailable or difficult to find. These datasets can be discovered on the Ocean Market, where they can be purchased and later consumed or sold.
> 
> On Ocean Protocol, each data service is represented by a unique datatoken, which is used to wrap a dataset or compute-to-data service — this essentially allows third-parties to perform operations on the data without it ever leaving the secure enclave of the publisher.
> 
> OCEAN is a utility token that is used for community governance and staking on data, in addition to buying and selling data as the basic unit of exchange on the Ocean Market. The price of these datatokens is set by an OCEAN-datatoken AMM pool, which adjusts the price of the datatoken as it is bought and sold based on supply and demand.",,,0.4939

Because the smart contracts that the Ocean token can be used with integrate additional functionalities that extend what ETH tokens are capable of doing. To achieve the same with the ETH token, the Ocean Protocol team would have to patch this functionality into the ETH token functions - and that is what everyone for all utility tokens would have to do.
But that would make the ETH token a very messy and risky endeavour if everyone would put their functionality on top of it. So the ERC20 token standard was invented to enable other projects e.g. Ocean Protocol to build their own tokens on top of ETH.",,"👍 (2),💯 (1)",0.2204

 to launch their trust infrastructure for a safer internet on #OceanMarket, and to build mechanisms to share data between the two platforms.

#TheYearOfScaling

👉 https://t.co/WhVyDv7ppZ?amp=1

Together, we'll be creating trust profiles of data providers & consumers, data sets & other entities on #OceanMarket. Users will be able to rate & review these, generating trust scores for them. #Blockchain tech rewards trustworthy actors & prevents manipulation of ratings.

🔐 @UTU_trust's vision is to make the internet a safer, more trusted place to gather, share, work, and trade. Fees for software dev & UTU API usage will be funded by the Ocean Protocol Foundation, and the bulk of the work will be completed by Q4 2021.

""This partnership will allow good actors on #OceanMarket to display the trust they’ve earnt, which in turn will incentivize others to trust those actors again and again,"" said @manan77patel, Growth Accelerator at Ocean",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/612953349003673629/856480738881699840/image0.jpg?ex=65e5a258&is=65d32d58&hm=797a0c8d1ce045ca727369e9160c58d36b156ac8a086d933d40bcd748a243a38&,,0.9919

1) Size of the market- currently a dormant market 
Multi trillion dollars 
This is for two main reasons:
-Privacy concerns (GDPR)
-Not wanting to sell information to competition.

2) Ocean doesn’t really have any direct competitors as Ocean is providing tools for people to create their own marketplace. Ocean is also leagues ahead in terms of partnerships and compute to data will is an incredible piece of technology.

3. SWOT
Strengths are obviously the team, the tech and the community.
Opportunities- Unlcoking the data economy for average people and SME
Weaknesses-  The biggest one I can think of is big companies like google not sharing their data but judging by GAIA X and their partnerships they have I suspect they might come round to changing their mind.

In short when looking at a company such as ocean, you need to look at three main things:
1) The Team
2) what the full fledged project will look like upon completion
3) Partnerships and accomplishments to date

Ocean excels above and beyond in all of these areas. I hope this answers your question!",,,0.9297

I apologize in advance. Can anyone tell me why use the ocean token? Why not use bitcoin or eth to purchase the data,,,0.1027
Ocean Protocol - GENERAL - 💭︱general-chat [612953349003673629],194817764236460034,robinlehmann,2021-07-02 18:51:00,"Hey, you are correct that thid question was asked before but let me give you my opinion anyways:

A new token offers the opportunity to add new properties to it. Ocean Protocol does that extensively - they offer the opportunity to launch datatokens using Ocean tokens, vote on OceanDAO grant rounds, and curate datasets with them as well as speculate on data assets.
None of these would be possible with ETH or BTC as the team is not in control of adding additional properties these tokens.

But the most important factor is the OceanDAO grants and the Web3 sustainability loop coupled with it. This is impossible to do without an Ocean token and guarantees the long term growth and health of the Ocean Protocol ecosystem. Checkout this article for more details:

Ocean Protocol doesn't rely on the OCEAN to buy & sell data. The Ocean smart contracts and drivers allow for any token to be used, in any exchange setting, since datatokens are ERC20 tokens. Ocean Market app has chosen to use OCEAN  to buy / sell / stake Ocean datatokens. Other apps can use other tokens. For example BDP Market uses BDP tokens. Ocean Market itself will move to using an OCEAN-backed stablecoin when the tech is ready.
This is all fine from an OCEAN perspective, because using OCEAN as a unit-of-exchange doesn't help drive fundamental value. Even more importantly, OCEAN token has been designed to have strong core value drivers: (a) increase in Ocean usage -> increase in network revenue -> increase in OCEAN burned; (b) governance token to allocate funding towards growth of OCEAN; and more. Details are at https://oceanprotocol.com/token. Hope that is a bit clearer. If you have any curiosities about Ocean, feel free to ask. ☺️",,👍 (1),0.9823

A good react developer with a crypto background can fork and set it up in 1-2 hours. (by forking Ocean Market - https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market

From scratch, same react dev can do it in 3-4 hours (depending on their CSS capabilities) using our React hooks - https://github.com/oceanprotocol/react

With react, a good html dev (with crypto know how) can built it from scratch in 5-6 hours (depending on their CSS capabilities) using directly ocean.js - https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js

** Non-crypto devs**

If dev is new to crypto, it is advised to understand how web3 wallets works and how smart contract works. A good starting point is our community created super-cool academy modules. - https://oceanacademy.io/

Once they acquire crypto understanding, then above estimations apply.

*It is adaptable to the point where there is zero-recognition or traceability back to the original form. For example, a user could take a structured table, cleanse it, join it with another data set, execute multiple calculations and end up with an unstructured PDF report or visualization that bears little or no resemblance to the original sources. If you start with unstructured data the traceability is even less.
*It is highly substitutable. For example, there may be many options available for sourcing company data and while there will be differences in coverage, timeliness and general reliability the data itself is substitutable.
*It is exceptionally diverse. Not only is the specific data diverse, but so are the formats, delivery mechanisms, frequency of update, terms and pricing. This makes it highly complex and difficult for people to engage with.
***It is often ‘raw’. The data that is available is rarely ready to support all of the diverse use cases for which it may be applicable meaning the consumer spends significant resources adapting it to a specific use case.**
*It is digital and easy to copy. This makes data easy to steal and coupled with a lack of traceability means it’s risky",,,-0.4953

Regarding spam datasets. Are you looking at “main” or including “test” too? Many users will first post datasets/algos to the test networks to familiarize themselves prior to main. It’s may also be used by the team for debug/testing… I believe Trent has posted some branin datasets.

1. In addition to what was said above, We cannot prevent spam. But you can go for a process to add datasets to purgatory. A complaint can be registered with reason/proof that falls under the existing policy on Ocean Market.
Please find the below link: https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory/blob/main/policies/README.md

2. The supply is distributed to platforms according to the liquidity provided on them and that which is made available for yield farming on various platforms too. There is no cause for concern.

Will also be easier to raise and spread awareness to the big subs like r/cryptocurrency because threads with enough comments and posts are easily cross postable/viewable. #1 engagement across all platforms so hope whoever currently mods or runs the reddit sees this and reconsiders their stance on keeping the subreddit locked down outside their threads.",,,0.9592

I'm new to the space and just made it through Ocean's technical whitepaper, so my question may be naive and have a simple answer: Wrapping the datasets as ERC20 tokens make a lot of sense, but it also implies that one wallet, or individual, is making the transaction and acquiring the ownership rights to a dataset. If the customer is a curious self-employed data scientist, then perfect! However, I would expect that traditional web2 corporate entities would be one such customer of these datasets.

I dont have a strong math/engineering background but I'd love to understand this at a first principle. Are there any resources you can send me way to get a better understanding on this?

Today, we're helping by providing insights to investors and data consumers about a data token's market health. We've been active in the community since more than a year now and so you might know some of us from GitHub. 

If you're holding OCEAN, we'd appreciate if you voted ""YES"" for Rug Pull Index. We have, as always, submitted a very detailed proposal of how we're spending the money and what things we've achieved. We want to use those funds as transparently as possible and consider ourself a public good that is available to anyone. 

Our proposal is here: https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/rugpullindex-com-improving-the-data-economys-safety/1169?u=timdaub

@Deleted User is quite experienced with establishing discord servers, community management processes, building bots, and growth hacking. 

Do you have any additional items (i.e. adjustment to moderator roles/permissions, additional tooling, processes, etc...) that we should be considering, so we can get them tracked & eventually rolled out?

Maybe we can tag some additional community managers (@mickssp? @Robin | DataUnion? others?) who might have some backlog items they would like to be tackled?",,,0.8295

It lets the data stay on-premise, yet allows 3rd parties to run specific compute jobs on it. 

Compute-to-Data on Ocean Market fits this need perfectly:
First, Data Publishers approve AI algorithms to run on their data. These algorithms could be published by Raven Protocol or other third parties.
Then, Compute-to-Data orchestrates remote computation and execution on data to train AI models.

In Ocean, a Compute-to-Data infrastructure is set up as a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster on, for example, AWS or Azure in the background. This Kubernetes cluster is responsible for running the actual compute jobs, out of sight for marketplace clients and end-users. While this is an incredible feat in itself, users and Data Publishers may want an alternative option in the Compute Providers they choose to approve. 

Federated learning provides the decentralized option when choosing a Compute Provider.

On top of that, it also ensures an additional layer of privacy for Ocean Compute-to-Data. Third parties could publish, for example, a Federated Learning algorithm. When run, a neural network is randomly initialized. Weight updates are computed next to the data itself in a data silo and then sent to the neural network. This is repeated in data silo #1, data silo #2, data silo #3, and so on. A neural network gets trained across many data silos without data leaving the premises of each respective silo.",,,0.9552

So Compute-to-Data inherently eliminates privacy concerns and so accomplishes a lot of the value of federated learning naturally. Then for those that want full guaranteed privacy, they can have an algorithm create equally weighted dummy sets of all the underlying datasets and run the ML model on these dummy sets instead of on the original raw data sets. The latter seems a bit of overkill if Compute to Data protects the raw data anyway, but I can see how the additional security would be needed for highly sensitive data. Would this be correct or would I be missing an aspect?",,,0.8067

Why I find this promising?

A) Have been on the fence so far wrt Data tokens and offerings so far, would be curious on having an experience with this.
B) This will increase the experience of Ocean community with the existing data-tokens that are part of the active pooling
C) Biased familiarity of course, so I've gone ahead and registered already.

What I would suggest?

A) Blogpost on how the Airdrop will work & how you are curating the airdrop choices.
B) Once the Airdrop happens, how can the average community engage with the liquidity pools that are active
C) An expectation of what behavior you expect for the data-token receivers.",,,0.9508

The series is my attempt at developing a personal thesis for what might happen if Data Access is financialized. I try to go beyond the usual discussions on technology and price and delve into things that aren't usually discussed - Data Valuation, Collaboration, the role of coming regulation and so on.

Please give it a read. Thanks!

Here’s Santiago from ITRMachines.

As proponents and winners of the 13th grant round we have been working in the implementation of a library that will allow Ocean developers to make a seamless integration with the AI library known as TensorflowJs.

 Today we present Oceanai-js (https://www.npmjs.com/package/oceanai-js), a plug and play library distributed on npm and ready to use with any kind of NodeJs or Typescript project.
 
In the coming days we will be announcing a workshop (this is our linkedIn handle: https://www.linkedin.com/company/itrmachines/) were we will showcase the advantages of using oceanai-js and how to use the library. The library is public so anyone can download it, use it, and of course alert us of any kind of bug or problem that arises when making use of it.",,,0.9081

It allows communities to aggregate on-chain and off-chain data/content into a single user experience.

It is about our own Marketplace on some custom URL like https://market.domain.tld with https://provider.domain.tld

1. Is this `serviceEndpoint` is a part which is stored on the Chain
https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/did-ddo/#rules-for-did--ddo
> An asset has a DID and DDO. The DDO should include metadata about the asset, and define access in at least one service. Only owners or delegated users can modify the DDO.

> All DDOs are stored on-chain in encrypted form to be fully GDPR-compatible.

https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/did-ddo/#services
> Services define the access for an asset, and each service is represented by its respective datatoken.

DDO contain Services (e.g. Provider URL) and it is stored on the Chain.

Can someone confirm that this is correct?

2. How can we update Provider URL of the already published datasets?
https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/did-ddo/#rules-for-did--ddo
> An asset has a DID and DDO. The DDO should include metadata about the asset, and define access in at least one service. Only owners or delegated users can modify the DDO.

Looks like DDO contain information about the service and DDO can be modified by the asset owner.

Earlier detection of cancer leads to earlier treatment, saving lives. A friend of mine builds Genetic Programming models to predict cancer. He’s happy if he has a dataset of 100 points, which, alas, means his models have poor predictive ability. Furthermore, each hospital site has bias due to differences in data collection, like how long a sample sits in a Petri dish before it’s measured. What if we could build models from data in 10 or 100 or more hospitals, while preserving privacy? There’s a way: bring the compute to the data, and build a model across hospitals using federated learning.
This is the direction for ConnectedLife, working on Parkinson’s, and leveraging Ocean Web3 data substrate.

The role of Big Data in Artificial Intelligence ❓ 

Artificial Intelligence needs data to build its intelligence, both initially, subsequently and continuously. The larger the amount of data that Artificial Intelligence systems can access, the more machines can learn and therefore more accurate and efficient their results will be.

As AI becomes smarter, less human intervention is required when it comes to process control and machine monitoring. Artificial Intelligence lives in a continuous learning phase in which it feeds on data continuously.

Just as Big Data is necessary for Artificial Intelligence, the same goes the other way around. Such vast amounts of data would not have the value they have without the Artificial Intelligence models, capable of unlocking the potential of these data stores and transforming them into intelligence.",,🔥 (1),0.9841

Do you know ❓ What exactly is the data economy, and why should it matter to you? And how can you lay the foundations for success in this world of near-boundless information?
📌 
The data economy represents global supply and demand for live data, data applications, and data services.

Succeeding in the data economy, or becoming a ""Data Economy Leader,"" requires deploying technology, executing organization-wide strategies, and using data in ways that were unthinkable to organizations just a few years ago. 

It all begins with three tried-and-true pillars: 📌 people 📌 process, and 📌 technology.",,,0.782

DDL: 📅15 Jun @ 10:00 AM UTC
This process is compulsory for pools with >500 $OCEAN Reserve. 

36 datasets have been highlighted to meet the minimum threshold of $OCEAN reserve, see the full list here:
🌊For pools with less than 500 $OCEAN in reserve, the gas fees for a data pool migration exceed the amount of $OCEAN locked. Thus, no action is required and datatoken holders will be compensated for the amount they staked directly.
Important:

Any LP that does not lock their pool shares by the deadline, will still be able to withdraw their stake but will NOT receive the 10% bonus.
What comes next? 👀💥

The Migration Day has been scheduled for 15 Jun 2022 ✅

All pool shares and datatokens will be burned, and airdrops will be sent to all those eligible in the Polygon network.",,,0.9318

I would have thought that it wouldn't matter and whichever address locks the LP tokens would get the value airdropped back to it, even if it was a gnosis safe contract wallet.

My name is Selcuk and I'm reaching out on behalf of PrimeDAO which provides crucial infrastructure and accessible tools within the DAO ecosystem for incumbents and new players. One of our product Prime Launch is a platform to host reliable and fair token launches on multiple chains. We have seed launch and LBP (Balancer V2) options available. We are not just launching tokens, also we curate them, we accelerate them and we invest them with our partners!  As I ve seen OceanDAO community grants; there are synergies between our two parties and we’d love to explore ways to collaborate. Appreciate if someone DM me regarding this topic.
 
Cheers,
Selcuk",,,0.9516

Solve rug pulls. In Ocean V3, a publisher would get all initial datatokens; malicious publishers could then rug pull. For V4, the publisher gets no initial datatokens. Instead, when someone adds OCEAN liquidity to a datatoken pool, a special one-sided staking bot mints enough datatokens into the pool to keep price constant. Similarly, when OCEAN liquidity is removed, the bot burns datatokens. Since the publisher is not a whale at the outset, they have nothing to rug pull (!). This mechanic also eliminates slippage when adding/removing OCEAN liquidity.
Data NFTs. We NFT-ize base IP to enable transfer of the base IP itself, to support >1 revenue streams on the base IP, to accumulate value to the base IP before monetization, and to leverage the recent growth of tooling in the NFT ecosystem. ERC20 datatokens remain as before: licenses to use the base IP.
Help community monetize. Now, 3rd party marketplaces can earn fees on from swapping, staking, and consuming (versus V3 just consuming), and have more control over fee rates (vs V3 hardcoded). V4 also includes architecture for >1 datatoken type, for more flexible fees, pay-as-you-go Compute-to-Data, and more.
Ocean V4 will include tooling to help migrate data assets and pools from Ocean V3. Ocean V4 will initially get deployed to all the same EVM chains as V3: Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Moonriver, Energy Web Chain. After that, we plan to deploy to more EVM chains over time.",,🧐 (1),0.9722

A vulnerability exists in Ocean pools where one could stake, buy datatokens, unstake, and then sell datatokens.

In certain pools with sufficient liquidity, this can be profitable and when performed repeatedly, will result in a portion of OCEAN being drained from the pool.

This vulnerability is mitigated with an increase in the swap fee to 15%. Thus, a new fee of 15% has been set and is live. Proceeds from this fee go back to the Ocean community.

We are looking at further measures to eliminate this attack vector and we’ll come back to you when we have something to report. 

Ocean Protocol has taken a snapshot and anyone that has taken a loss will be compensated.

Following feedback from the community and recent learnings, we are introducing veOCEAN to best align the incentives of token holders and liquidity providers.  

Continue reading 👇 <https://t.co/Cme16cby0x>

How?🌟 

veOCEAN holders can lock their $OCEAN tokens over a time period to earn rewards and voting power. The longer the lock period, the higher the rewards and the voting power.

They can also vote on proposals and earn rewards, both from consume fees and data farming.

veOCEAN holders can earn passive rewards, solely by locking their $OCEAN. 

Or, they can be active by allocating veOCEAN to higher-quality datasets for greater earnings.

Going forward, veOCEAN will be the main mechanism for staking $OCEAN and for curation of datasets. It’s lower risk than Ocean datatoken pools, and it delivers similar benefits.

$85,000 USD in OCEAN are available for Web3 data economy projects that will build on Ocean and contribute to its growing ecosystem!🌊

DDL - Aug 2 @ midnight UTC

Round 20 will be geared towards 👇
 
✅Biasing to those who engage for the love of doing it. An engaged, diverse community.

✅Rewards flow to contributors (with OCEAN) who are effective at delivering results. 

✅More efficient capital spending, yet lighter tracking overhead

Approaches to improving OceanDAO⚒

🌊Starting with R21, the main pillar will be retroactive grants only for outcomes already achieved.

🌊OceanDAO will give more space to earlier-stage projects compared to experienced ones, by capping the total funding amount for a project.

Round 20 Changes 👀

💡Total funding of 75,000 USD (min.)

💡100,000 USD max. per project in a lifetime

💡100,000 USD max. per team in a lifetime (not including Advisors)

Funding ceiling per tier

💡New projects - 3K USD 

💡Existing projects -  7.5K USD (have completed one grant from OceanDAO)

💡Experienced projects - 15K USD (have completed two or more grants)

In the next Round 21, we will also introduce the following 👇

🚀Retroactive Grants - Projects will apply for grants that fund the outcome of work they did, not plan to do

🚀2 Months Cycle per Round - Total funding of 150,000 USD available

🚀New funding ceilings per tier

You are encouraged to submit proposals early via the Proposal Portal. Note that proposals can no longer be submitted through Ocean Port directly.

Hey buddy, Datatoken pools will not be available from now on. Please see disclaimer above. 

You can find a better alternative and staking option here;  veOCEAN will be the main mechanism for staking $OCEAN and for curation of datasets. It’s lower risk than Ocean datatoken pools, and it delivers similar benefits. https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol/status/1546878528813400064",,,0.4559

Hey buddy, Datatoken pools will not be available from now on. Please see disclaimer above. 

You can find a better alternative and staking option here;  veOCEAN will be the main mechanism for staking $OCEAN and for curation of datasets. It’s lower risk than Ocean datatoken pools, and it delivers similar benefits. https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol/status/1546878528813400064",,,0.4003

Three ways to bundle NFTs (data NFTs or otherwise):
1. Send NFTs to a 1-of-1 multisig. Transfer via temporary 1-of-2. Eg via Gnosis Safe.
2. Send NFTs into an NFT-ized eth address. Eg Emblem Vault.
3. Group NFTs via a token-grouping protocol. Eg ERC998

We're thrilled to announce that the integration with @H2O_data is completed, and $H2O is now available in Ocean Market. 

$H2O will enable data buyers and sellers to benefit from more price stability.

How? Let's take a quick look 👀

What is H2O and why is it important? 💧 

✅$H2O is an $OCEAN backed, non-pegged stable asset, aiming to be the de facto medium of exchange within the entire Web3 Data ecosystem and based on the RAI stable asset by @reflexerfinance.

✅$H2O is decentralized, permissionless, minimizes governance and typically settles at ~$1.60

Since data can now be priced in $H2O, and $H2O fluctuates far less than $OCEAN, users can benefit from very little exposure to volatility in Ocean Market. This will bring two near-term benefits:

1️⃣  First, data sellers get more predictable revenue as revenue is no longer dependent on $OCEAN price.
2️⃣ Second, data buyers have more predictable costs as costs are no longer dependent on $OCEAN price.

❔How do I get $H2O tokens?
Locking OCEAN to mint $H2O via the H2O dapp here: https://app.h2odata.xyz  
Buy $H2O in an exchange such as the Uniswap: https://buff.ly/3ysO2p5

I will like to take this oportunity to precent our latest development to the community that is Oceanai-py.

The current state of the library allows developers to connect directly to the Ocean-lib service provider modules, and to obtain datasets using the already stablished Ocean market pipeline. Once the datasets are retrieved Oceanai-py allows for an easy and quick implementation of the ai model of your preference, this is done using Tensorflow as an engine.

If you are a developer, and would like to know more, we invite you to check https://github.com/itrm-team/oceanai-py or in https://pypi.org/project/oceanai-py/, to see how can you make use of the library.

Also, I will like you to invite you to our official Discord server https://discord.gg/kAPY3pPC as it will be hosting an AMA about the library that we just made public , the AMA will be taking place at 9:00 AM GMT-5, this 2th of September

Get ready, Oceaners! 🛠️

👀veOCEAN goes live next Monday (Sep 26). Data Farming will resume three days later (Thursday)!🌊

Let's dive into the details!👇

⁉️What is veOCEAN? 
 It is the main mechanism for locking $OCEAN and for curating datasets on Ocean - it’s lower risk than datatoken pools, and delivers more benefits.

What can I do with veOCEAN?👇
✅ Lock $OCEAN to receive veOCEAN, and earn passive rewards. 

✅ Use veOCEAN to curate data with high Data Consume Volume (DCV) and get even more rewards.

✅ Vote on @OceanDAO_ proposals

Here is an overview of the timeline⏰

📅Sep 26: veOCEAN goes live. Lock your OCEAN for veOCEAN at http://df.oceandao.org

📅Sep 29: Counting for Data Farming /DF5 resumes

📅Oct 6: DF5 payouts resume. Counting starts for DF6

📅Oct 13: DF6 payout; DF7 counting starts

Please note ⚠️

DF will follow phases as before. When it resumes, it will be with a new “VE/DF Alpha” phase for 4 weeks. “DF Beta” and “DF Main” phases will follow, as previously targeted.

Want to know more? 🤔

1) is there a dashboard or any other way to check how much OCEAN has been burned up to now from burning 5% of the network revenue?
2) is this burning mechanism still active and is the parameter still 5%?
3) does the burn happen automatically with every transaction that generates network revenues? Or does it accumulate in a pool address and the burn is activated ""manually"" after a certain threshold?

🔘Ocean: transferable, used for incentives by issuance;
🔘ve: non-transferable, locked in by depositing the base token into a voting escrow contract, with a term of 1 week to 4 years; ve lockers vote on which permit pools should be incentivized and accumulate all protocol fees.  

Here come three important deviations from the standard:

1. Weekly emissions are adjusted as a percentage of circulating supply (Total Supply Ocean - ve Locked Supply). 
As more tokens are vested, the impact of emission is decreased.

2. ve lockers increase their holdings proportional to the weekly emission. The goal is to ensure that ve lockers are never diluted. 

3. Ve locks are NFTs. By tokenizing the lock position this allows a single address to own more than one lock, locks balances are cumulative and each lock contributes to the overall ve balance. This further allows locks to be traded on secondary markets.",,,0.8948

Community fees: Every transaction in Ocean Market and Ocean backend generates transaction fees, some of which go to the community. 50% of the community fees will go to veOCEAN holders; the rest will go to OceanDAO grants, etc. All earnings here are passive.

Data Farming: veOCEAN holders will get each weekly DF rewards allocation, except a small carveout for DF Crunch. For DF rewards, veOCEAN holders can be passive, though they will earn more if active. “Being active” means allocating veOCEAN to promising data assets (data NFTs). Then, rewards follow the usual DF formula: DCV * stake. But now, stake is the amount of veOCEAN allocated to the data asset, rather than liquidity in a datatoken pool. (And this stake is safe: you can’t lose your OCEAN as it is merely locked.)",,👍🏻 (1),0.9207

DF week 5 has now concluded🚜👩‍🌾

💰10K OCEAN worth of rewards were available for this round and all the LPs can claim their rewards 👀🌊

Let's see how you can do it!👇

✅Visit the DF webapp Claim Portal at https://df.oceandao.org
✅Connect your Wallet
✅For each network where you staked: select network, click “Claim”, sign the TX, get rewards

👩‍🌾Rewards will accumulate over weeks so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound gains.

The counting for DF6 begins this week and ends October 13th @ 12:01 AM UTC. 

Catalyzed by recent events, veOCEAN effectively replaces pools as the DF staking mechanism.

Want to find out more about the current status of rewards?

-there  are many datasets available for purchase on the marketplace and you can find them here:
https://market.oceanprotocol.com/

-The review process works in the form of purgatory which allows people  to submit requests to block, datasets that violates the existing policy of the Ocean Market
Datasets that are considered to violate the rules are reported and removed from the marketplace.
You can check out the rules here:

Welcome 🙂 We are working hard to attract more data scientists to our young platform to publish data and algos! In fact, we recently expanded our developer relations team to bring you more publishers of data/algos. While we don’t review for bias in datasets, we do have a process of reviewing datasets for inappropriate material. Ocean users mostly include data scientists and enthusiasts looking to generate revenue. You can earn revenue by staking your $OCEAN token or by holding your $OCEAN token and getting paid out rewards as datasets are sold. We do work with several partners, and our collaborations are shown frequently in our Twitter. Very good questions, all of them. Cheers!",,👍🏾 (2),0.9466

It's helpful to grasp:
- Long term, multi-marketplace strategy of Ocean Protocol (part reason of current fee strucuture -> future scale)
- Regulation for Enterprises in Blockchain
-- E.g.: We tweaked our stack with MB to comply with European Regulation/Standards
--- like: making data NFTs non transferable
--- allow for insta-redemption of token, removing the speculative threat (regulation)

Could be an eye-opener, or ""convincer"" for partners you work with. 

Scenarios can include:
- Put your customers data onto Acentrik, do magic from there
- Build your own market, and go with learnings from our work with Mercedes (Regulation)

Just a heads up.

Passive rewards - Dispensed
Active rewards - To be dispensed

Why: We have to wait until the epoch ends to run the calculations and get the rewards out the door. 

There is still a significant amount of work before we automate this and it may be a few more epochs until we get this in place.

Thought I'd share something brief until we have the active rewards distributed and provide an official update on the completion of DF9.

Consume for DF dataset (https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:81a2c9959bf2a03e7c9b21f95e24b457cb28c880e28e3670cb0a736372d0ad05) was 1000 $OCEAN, Stake was 3.000.000 => 3.000.000.000 DCV if we discount the switch of the tokens for the last 2 days it would be:
1000 $OCEAN * (3.000.000 * 5/7 + 2.000.000 * 2/7) = 1000 $OCEAN * 2.714.000 => 2.714.000.000

Consume for the Clash dataset (https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:3dd05b9f564b9f43609e03121351b83bb1fa0a64b94e5635a3990679318b5dc5) was 25.000 $OCEAN, stake was 1.000.000 => 25000 * 1.000.000 * 2/7 = 7.142.857.142

Which would mean that the Clash dataset should have gotten ~2.5* the reward of the DF dataset.

If I check that with the reward numbers computed in the DF dataset then this does not reflect the reward distribution.

Maybe I am missing something here?",,,0.872

RF_ij = (stake_ij/(Σi stake_ij)) * (DCV_j/(Σj DCV_j)

We are interested in checking the RF for complete datasets and not individuals, so we remove the i component by adding up all the stakes in the dataset:

RF_j = ((Σi stake_ij)/(Σi stake_ij)) * (DCV_j/(Σj DCV_j) = (DCV_j/(Σj DCV_j)

So if we look at the last round and consumes of two datasets:
* the DF farming one: RF_df = DCV_df / (Σj DCV_j), and its consumes DCV_df = 1000 $OCEAN
* the Clash of clans one: RF_clash = DCV_clash / (Σj DCV_j) and its consumes DCV_clash = 25000 $OCEAN
* the sum of all the consumes is (Σj DCV_j) = 26.000 $OCEAN

Then this results in RF_df = 1000 / 26000 and RF_clash = 25000 / 26000 - so the RF_clash dataset should have gotten basically all the rewards due to its high DCV.

I am assuming here that RF is always resulting in the share of the total rewards for the round - e.g. if RF = 0.1 and the total rewards are 1000, then the reward would be 100. But the article does not mention this.",,,0.8608

""Steam Reviews Dataset 2021"" has by far the highest DCV with more than 15k USD sales volume in this round - so stakers would get an APY of 60% here. However, when taking a closer look, the dataset is priced incredibly high with 7.5k USD per usage for a day (so it was sold twice during this round to reach 15k USD sales volume). Although it is kind of outside my circle of competence, I find it hard to believe that someone would pay that much for this dataset.

Sovryn, being built natively on Rootstock, is a much better, native system, however does not exist beyond the BTC ecosystem.

There are many regulatory and compliance challenges Stables may find themselves in the future, specifically with trying to remain pegged to the USD.

I believe that if you really want to sell this data, it's important to extract more actionable insights and then make it obvious how to extract value from it.

Example, the first way I made money in crypto was selling arbitrage intelligence.
I made it extremely easy for people to see the arb gaps, and close it.
I then added alerts around it so people received notifications.

If you can help people make money, then people are very willing to pay you for it.
If you just deploy data in the market, it may not feel as actionable or valuable.

I have put together this presentation to give an idea of how this can be setup.

Hi everyone, I have kicked off this personal project as a way to support the Ocean Protocol community, and to create a bridge with the Nouns DAO community.

**What is it?**
Ocean Nouns (oceannouns.wtf) is meant to be a community-owned, fund-raising mechanism for ecosystem projects to obtain some pretty fun NFT PFPs that blend the worlds of Nouns DAO (nouns.wtf) with Ocean Protocol .

You can read all about it in the proposal that I linked below!

**How can you support?**
I have submitted a proposal to Nouns Prop House in the hopes of raising money for the project.
You can find the proposal in the tweet below, and I would love to receive your support by linking, retweeting, and just overall engaging with it **(this first tweet, not the second tweet)**.
https://twitter.com/oceannouns/status/1613086424554668032

**If this proposal wins, it would add 10 ETH of funding into the project to: pay for artists, setup an LLC, deploy contracts, and many other important details.**
My goal is to promote the project over the weekend to hopefully increase the number of votes.
Your support with bringing visibility to this tweet would be very helpful and go a long way.

**What else is going on??**
I am currently creating some prototype/mock art that represents many different ecosystem projects, data-engineering and data-science concepts (like the python logo), data arming, and much more. I have attached the first prototype to this messsge.

We're building out a credential data network and projects are using us to leverage credential data on-chain and off-chain through task-based NFTs to build stronger communities and products. You can consider us a growth marketing tool and an infrastructure to build out loyalty programs in the form of NFTs. 
We have worked with many DEX's to help them reward loyal and early contributors, drive awareness + engagement + knowledge of their product, and increase their user base while also driving social activity on social platforms. Some of our partners include Binance, Solana, Polygon, Hashflow, and Yearn Finance.

Of course, there is speculation around this token as with every other crypto token, and often the valuation includes sentiment about how valuable $OCEAN will be in the future when data sharing of Ocean dataNFTs and datatokens occurs more and more on EVM blockchains.

First, 
what i see on the explorer is a contract for OCEAN tokens. Not ""anytokens"", so please show me on a screenshot how  do you know it is a fake coin, and how we are supposed to know if even MULTICHAIN support does not talk about it when I reach to them ?
So, now that I was not informed during the bridging that they gave me a fake coin in exchange of my real OCEAN assets, I sent them directly to binance BSC ocean wallet and they pretend those coins are now in space and lost. 
It is interesting to me how your partner can just steal my assets (by stealing the name of YOUR brand to cheat us) pretending they have your assets but they give me fake coin instead. By the way they gave me 100% in this other token. So there was NO LIQUIDITY AT ALL. And nothing was notified.
Can you tell me how can this be just ok for everybody ? How would you think about all this if you went through it  What would you do now ?  what are the solutions now  please ? This is what interest me here seen the situation. 
How can I recover those assets, even if they are fake OCEAN coins, to get my money back ? 
Will there be a clever dev who can help since you are partnering also with Binance
Thanks a lot in advance, hope this can be recoverd",,,0.9437

The token you received is not a fake token, it is a token created by Anyswap. You can see that the token is tagged as ""Anyswap: OCEAN Protocol"" in the BSC explorer. To further understand how it works and why you received this token, please refer to sections 2.2 and 2.3 in the Multichain docs.

If you've already sent the tokens to an exchange, I suggest you contact the exchange's support team and explain the situation. They might be able to help you and return the tokens. In that case, you should be able to exchange them back to OCEAN through Multichain (Anyswap). For more information about this, please see the ""2.3 Liquidity Removal"" section in the Multichain docs.

I will also bring this issue up to the team to see if there is another solution. In the meantime, please let me know if you have any other questions or if you need any further assistance.

Sending me back to the dos does not help. it just says we can get anytoken if not enough liquidity. It is even not well detailed, explained, and as I said, I got no notification of this. Impossible to know I got a fake temporary coin counterfeiting your brand instead of my real OCEAN asset.
 
As a customer they do not care. Binance just said I have to pay 500$ for them to investigate what is ""lost"". This is the kind of respect we get.
I suppose if you partner with them, a dev could know what to do and help me seen the situation ? Would be a great move as you offer to do. 
I definitely wait for you to come back with some hope.
Because Multichain is a scam for now. I don't even understand how they can start a swap knowing they don't have liquidity AT ALL and make me the scammed one.

Or do I have to read all those 20+ blog posts about data farming to figure this out? Cause they all just talk about hypothetical scenarios. What are the real life numbers now that multiple farming rounds have been done? The post you linked talks about some liquidity pools which are not there. And no distinction between active and passive rewards. And that post claims we should have something between 66% - 125% APY in the 5.3 Example APYs table. Is this active or passive rewards?

Where is your documentation on expected APY on passive rewards? Your app currently says ""6.35% Avg APY"" for passive rewards and ""0.00% Avg APY"" for active reqwards. So nothing like 66% -125% but then again there are numbers being thrown around here without any real-life validation. Would be great to actually have a single place documented about this.

I’m Paul a representative for Stuart (AKA The Wordsmith) - a bestselling author and tier 1 content writer in the space. He has worked with numerous well-known projects and produced countless articles and press releases (among numerous other types of content) – many which have gone viral.

As a scout I reach out to awesome projects I know Stuart would love to work with. To that end, I was hoping to speak to a member of the team so I can put them in touch with the Wordsmith directly to see if they might want to have him produce content for the company. I can also link them to his website, which has a bunch of examples as well as testimonials from other project leads. 

So could someone direct me to who would be best to speak to? Thank you and hope you all have an awesome rest of your day 😊",,,0.9878

Great question! When a user pays for access to your dataset using datatokens, they are essentially purchasing a license to use the data for a specific purpose. The license terms can be set by you, the data owner, and enforced by smart contracts. This means that if a user tries to share or sell the data without permission, they would be in violation of the license terms and could face penalties or loss of access to the data. 
Additionally, you can publish data as c2d. This means that users don't get access to your dataset but they can run algorithms(that you approve of) on top of that data and download only the results of the computation.",,,0.6948

I understand your frustration, however I would like to point out that we have also tried to communicate with you directly. Our colleague, @White Rider reached out to you on discord, yet you didn’t reply, and Bruce also explained the situation on Linkedin. Let me give you some more information on what happened. 
There are two ways to move tokens between eth and bsc: binance bridge and multichain bridge. They both work fine, but they create different versions of ocean token on bsc. The one you used was multichain bridge, which gave you ocean tokens with this address: 0x3516141b1ac8751c2042a8a1bc411ab8655464ac. The problem is that when you wanted to go back to eth, you used binance bridge instead of multichain bridge. Binance bridge only recognizes ocean tokens with this address: 0xdce07662ca8ebc241316a15b611c89711414dd1a. So when you sent your tokens to binance bridge, they got lost because binance doesn't track them.",,,-0.743

But I NEVER USED Binance bridge. NEVER. I used MULTICHAIN Bridge from eth chain to BSC chain. And I received the fake token you mention. INDEED. I never ""went back to eth"" I do NOT understand what bs you talk ABOUT?? . Show me on the blockchain a link and proof of this nonsense. I have all the screendhots and the explorer shows it clearly. Why this bs about binance bridging or ""coming back to eth"" ? 
Besides that I always replied to @White Rider which did not answered my questions either. Like Bruce Pon on LinkedIn which totally missed the point too trying to avoid my questions LIKE HERE. 
Out of 9 questions I will ask 2 only AGAIN in hope I'll have a proper answer this time about this theft rather than avoiding them all the time. Be honest and pro at least. 
 
1) Who wrote the smart contract that gave me shitcoins instead of my real assets?

2) And why did I get shit tokens from MULTICHAIN if the bridging from eth to BSC was ok with no liquidity problems since it was ""successful"" ?

I just want the real assets I should have get and not fake coins 🔥

Q1: Who wrote the smart contract that gave me shitcoins instead of my real assets?
(https://bscscan.com/token/0x3516141b1ac8751c2042a8a1bc411ab8655464ac)
Multichain (former Anyswap: https://multichain.org/ ) told me Ocean team wrote it. Which dev wrote it?
A: The contracts were written by multichain and are owned by them. We have no control over the bridges that are created, as anyone can create bridges.
The tokens that multichain release are valid coins that you can bridge back to Ethereum, through the multichain bridge.
Q2: And why did I get shit tokens from MULTICHAIN if the bridging from eth to BSC was ok with no liquidity problems since it was “successful” ?
A: Based on your previous messages and transaction, it looks like you did send the tokens to the binance bridge. Binance has automated services and probably can’t access that wallet , you should probably contact them for more information. See the attached screenshots for more support details. Binance is displaying what contract address is expecting and multichain is warning you.
I do hope that this helps shed some light into your matter and will support in you finding some resolution.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/612953349003673629/1092455348452995072/Screenshot_2023-04-03_125026.png?ex=65e5da53&is=65d36553&hm=a8c77789f1043ab803741e06ee3f9dde2beb140c9b8483be066f8e24ae70f9a6&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/612953349003673629/1092455348704657448/binance.png?ex=65e5da53&is=65d36553&hm=96c1ca48870c42492087ab1e72c26cdeb731fc5cd4041c6b197b042319925e16&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/612953349003673629/1092455348968886322/multichain.png?ex=65e5da54&is=65d36554&hm=908bb3d90b8a84d0c3d21bae4995de830384326ef9dda468aca2d92839809f3f&",,0.9157

And: What technology and services  does Ocean Protocol provide in the future for these ecosystems and how does that go together with Polygon Supernets?Hope somenone can help me 🙂 Thx!  https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/720631710785732638/1084868590525759649",,Oceancopy (3),0.9208

For question 1, Multichain said Ocean team wrote the contract. Seems they lie then? I can provide screenshot also. 😉 

For question 2, I'm not asking about anything after the bridging (bridging was, made on metamask, from mm to mm) . I'm asking why did the bridging say status ""successful"" . Why was he ""successful"" if there was no liquidity enough (and giving temporary shit token), confusing us in thinking we had the right token?

Regarding question 1 . I'm no disputing what you discussed with them. We didn't write or deploy any contract for the bridge. Anybody can create a bridge for any token. As you can see on https://www.bnbchain.org/en/bridge there are 2 alternative bridges (they probably have a partnership/agreement with them, we are not involved in this) . As well as for other chains there are multiple bridges. Unfortunately the user needs to figure out what bridge he wants or needs to use. You can also provide the screenshot .
Regarding question 2, you got the tokens, so the status was indeed ""successful"" . They didn't give you a shit token, but that token can only be bridged back to eth only on the multichain bridge. I agree with you, bridging in web3 is a bit confusing . You need to pay attention to all the addresses and instructions. This would have had the same outcome with any token that you bridged , not just ocean.",,,0.0547

There is a mechanism for returning 1-3% of transaction fees (I forget the exact amount) to the Ocean Protocol Foundation if a marketplace (or dApp?) does not use $ocean as its main currency. The OPF can then choose to use a portion of that revenue to buy back $ocean from the open market (in theory) but increaseing $ocean price isn't a priority of the tokenomics.

There would have to be a tremendous amount of buy back for it to really affect the $ocean price in the first place. The entire 1-3% wouldn't be earmarked for BB. It would be a tiny portions of that and the rest assigned for other activities. Secondly, buy back is just a mooted option. In reality the the fees are more likely to be used to build the wider Ocean economy and for long-term sustainability of the project (sensible).

Ocean is 'better' than others with a bigger cap so it should have a big cap too? Not sure what metric is being used to determine this. Those larger cap projects generally have more trading volume whether by design (tokenomics) or a larger community. Adoption is the only way ocean will see rapid increase in value. If organic volume comes to the ecosystem then it could outperform otherwise it will largely follow the market (bot trading).,,,-0.0354

Native turns “exchange” into a feature so any app can deploy their own swap in minutes.

Using Native, projects earn all their own swap fees. Depending on volume, fee revenue can be upwards of 6-7 figures / month, straight to the project treasury.

Native also has integrations with professional market-makers (PMMs) which are normally only available to CEXs. This makes it super easy (and free) for a project to go live with a tier 1 liquidity provider on chain. Using Native is a way to get deep liquidity and high capital efficiency on-chain without losing revenue through emissions or incentives.

At the end of the day, Native is about helping projects get more liquidity and earn more revenue. Let me know if you would like to further discuss how we can help you increase revenue while creating a seamless experience for your users.

Thank you✌🏻",,,0.9796

Telling me different country's timezones is totally unhelpful, a little demeaning, and only highlights the necessity to record important discussions for an international audience. 

"". And the info there is simply executing on a policy that we've communicated since the earliest days of Ocean. "" 
 Never heard that before. Any source that says team were minting all tokens? 

From the article: ""This (minting the rest of the supply) will make it un-pausable, and fully decentralized & censorship-resistant."" 
How? These are just buzzwords with no explanation... how is that 7 anonymous people controlling 56%+ of the supply is unpausable, censorship resistant, or decentralised? (Not to mention the other ~30% under Binance's control)

This whole process seems so suspicious to me and the inadequate explanation even more so. Completely dejected from this project and disappointed how communication with the community has been neglected.",,,-0.9546

Tokens are issued to be minted, otherwise why would a project deploy their token all together? 

Now, a project may decide to mint all of them on day 1, or leave a portion to be minted at a later schedule. That’s why often times you see a lower “circulating supply market cap” than “fully diluted market cap”.
Chainlink is a good example: https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca

The Ocean whitepaper should be the one and only reference, and as I said, the AMA has added no more information than the one was already presented to the community via the 2 articles above.

Within the whitepaper you can see that 719,100,000 OCEAN (51%) has always been earmarked for community incentives as per Ocean tokenconomics.

Now, of this amount:

- 503,370,000 OCEAN (70% of the 51%) is for Data Farming with vesting over decades.

You can also look at the vesting schedule directly from the Github/source code, as all code/actions are ALWAYS open-sourced and well documented in our github. 
Vesting schedule halving example: https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/VestingWalletHalving.sol 

- 215,730,000 OCEAN (30% of the 51%) is for future community incentives projects, held by the 51% multisig wallet. 

I hope this clarifies!",,,0.865

The AMA was about revoking control over the minting contract by minting all the tokens. Why are you explaining basic tokenomics to me? 

Let me make myself very clear and please correct me if I'm wrong. 
All of the tokens have been minted onto the Ethereum blockchain, in lieu of the team having control over the minting contract. 
The newly minted tokens are stored in a number (?) of multi-sig wallets controlled by 7 entities. 
(Can we have the addresses of these wallets?)
A new 'un-pausable' contract has been created to vest the tokens as community rewards through DF.
**Why have the team done this? What problem did this remedy?** **How is this 'fully decentralised'? How is this 'censorship resistant'? **

Now we have to __trust__ these 7 entities, (who will remain anonymous I assume) to carry out the same tokenomics for decades. 
The tokenomics have been altered at least 2 times in the last 2 years.

What's the github link you sent? Is this the current contract working on the new multi-sig wallets or the old contract?",,,0.5743

Not precisely, the 719,100,000 OCEAN (51% of OCEAN supply) has been sent to 1 single wallet, not multiple wallets. You can check the TX: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9286ab49306fd3fca4e79a1e3bdd88893042fcbd23ddb5e705e1029c6f53a068 for more details. The wallet holding the newly minted Ocean is: 0x4D9B76Df13DF257A674AEc7Ec7232741A6E73883

This wallet is ""controlled"" by 7 signees, correct. The signees are from OPF, OPC and other renowned signees that are well renowned in the Web3 space.

1) Why is the token un-pausable and more decentralised now? 
Because the majority of newly minted tokens are programmed to go towards Data Farming following a BTC-like vesting curve. The contracts proving the release & vesting are open-source and can always be monitored at: 

- https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/VestingWalletHalving.sol
- https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/VestingWalletLinear.sol

  2) Why has the team renounced ownership?
To have one less point of failure in the system. Ocean's vision has always been to slowly (**but responsibly**) move to a fully decentralised architecture, with ideally zero points of failure to make Ocean fully censorship resistant. 

However, this comes in little steps. And as the technology becomes more mature/robust, the more smart contract automation will be taking place. And more keys will be thrown away (hence also the multi-sig). 

This is what further enhance security and will eventually make Ocean fully community-owned, just like Bitcoin. No owners, but its community! 

Does this clarify?",,👍 (1),0.7514

A dataNFT (ERC721) has its own DID and DDO. Within the DDO you can define one, or more than one, services. Each service has it’s own DT.

Example, let’s imagine you want to sell a JavaScript course. These are 2 examples of how you could Ocean DTs:

EXAMPLE 1
The course is called JavaScript, and has 3 tiers. This course will be represented as a dataNFT with its own DID/DDO. In the DDO, you add 3 services to represent each tier, each of which will be represented by its own datatoken.

JavaScript Course (ERC721)
JavaScript Basics for Beginners (DT1 for free)
JavaScript Intermediate (DT2 @ USDC 100)
JavaScript Full Course (DT3 @ USDC 299)
(edited)

EXAMPLE 2
Alternatively, each tier can also be represented as a dataNFT and have its own DID/DDO with only one service:

JavaScript Basics for Beginners (ERC721)
DT1 for free
JavaScript Intermediate (ERC721)
DT1 @ USDC 100
JavaScript Full Course (ERC721)
DT1 @ USDC 299

Each service can be customised quite flexibly to have a different price, expiry date, whitelist and more",,👍 (3),0.7346

Hi everyone, I've recently been able to ramp up the efforts behind OceanNouns and we've been putting out some updates.
We're now looking forward to your feedback.

The NFT collection is built on top of the NounsDAO stack and will end up having nearly the exact same architecture/mechanisms.
You can read a bit more about the project here:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DZHKLbfOjz_5jR7qdZfC_ol-j0nPi95V1zbkCbaOiOM/edit#slide=id.p

**[Nouns & Art Feedback]**
Our artist wanted to try a few different things and ended up creating a bunch of characters that we both love.
However, we're really looking forward to building with the community and wanted to get people's feedback.
https://twitter.com/oceannouns/status/1664044458147737600

**[Sample NFTs & Traits]**
I attached a couple more characters to give you all a feel for the style.

**[Sample Teaser]**
We also put together a little teaser.
https://twitter.com/oceannouns/status/1668854170282254336

**[Questions for the community]**
How do you feel about this art direction when compared to NounsDAO?
(if the images are too big, try zooming out, Nouns are 32x32 pixels big)

**Would you prefer to see:**

I've been doing research on Ocean and looking for the answers to these Q's: 

Are there any projects that are doing liquid staking wrappers for veOCEAN?

Judging from the https://df.oceandao.org/datafarming page, no one is currently really buying the data? Is that an accurate understanding and why the yields on Active Rewards have been 0.00% for the past few months?

Is there more chains to the Data Farming, or is it only currently running on Ethereum?

The structure looks like this - 

1) you locked your 100 ocean for 6 months , and in return you will get Veocean . Now, by either just holding your VeOcean , you can earn passive rewards or you can stake them on potential datasets and earn active rewards ! 

That's the basic understanding of it . 

But, during the end period of your lock period , your VeOcean starts to decay and if you want to earn more, you need to relock your ocean token

I have a question about Compute 2 Data & selling Data using Ocean Marketplace

**Option 1:** So if you sell the **dataset**, as downloadable, the user has it and now can do wtv they want with it, including copying and sharing it. 

**Option 2: ** Make the dataset, **Compute**. Now here there is the 3 step process "" create an algorithm that's compatible with C2D, publish your C2D-specific algorithm NFT, then publish your data NFT with C2D configurations allowing the algorithm to compute on it. "" I understand this keeps the data private while providing access to use it.

The algorithm part confuses me. **Are users limited on how they can play with the data by the algorthim i provide? **

Let me try to respond to your questions:

Option 1 - If you choose to publish a dataset as downloadable, interested buyers can acquire datatokens to gain access to it. The data provider ensures privacy by encrypting the source details such as the URL or IPFS id. However, buyers can download the data. When users purchase access through datatokens, they essentially obtain a license to use the data for a specific purpose set by the data provider and enforced by smart contracts. Nevertheless, tracking and monitoring if they share or use the data differently from its intended purpose can be challenging due to the decentralized nature of the system.

Option 2 - Anyone can develop algorithms to process your dataset. To facilitate this, it's crucial to include sufficient information in the dataset documentation, allowing users to understand its structure without directly accessing the raw data. Best practices involve providing a sample file that demonstrates the data's format.
However, to prevent potential data theft or misuse, the data publisher must approve algorithms before they are allowed to run on the dataset. This approval process helps ensure that only trustworthy and non-malicious algorithms can access and process the data, safeguarding its integrity and security.


I hope this clears up any confusion you may have.",,,0.9871

Might be something like, downloable dataset but with 6 month timelag and an educational walkthrough for using the dataset with AI to gain insights.

 The C2D is a bit more of a professional service, would have up to date data but not be downloable only computable.

Not sure yet, first need to better understand ocean

Some alternatives include using the data we collect to build our own AI model thus allowing peoplw to analyze it in natural language, but im not sure yet where the ocean stack fits in to this part",,,0.8901

That does help clarify. The need to review and approve algorithms before they can compute the data does seem to be a bit of a obstacle to scaling/automation. Although probably not an issue for an MVP.

Can you accurately predict the price of ETH? 

There's 5,000 OCEAN in weekly prizes for those who can do it with the lowest error.

https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97

We've run ""Predict-ETH"" Data Challenges for several months.

Participants had to predict ETH price 5 min, 10 min, …, 60 min ahead. Reward $ goes to those with lowest prediction error.

Now, Predict-ETH Data Challenge is transforming into Challenge DF. 

Challenge DF is part of Ocean DF. 🚜🪼

Why:
- Lower overhead --> uses DF ops
- Preps the stage for more evolution yet 👀

Data Farming's updated structure:

- Active DF: 75K OCEAN weekly. Earn by locking OCEAN for veOCEAN.

- Passive DF with substreams:
   - Volume DF: 70K OCEAN weekly. Earn by pointing veOCEAN to high-DCV assets
   - Challenge DF [new]: 5K OCEAN weekly. Earn by predicting ETH

Challenge DF Details
- Predictions are due every Wed, right before midnight
- Predict for Thu at 12.05am, 12.10am, ..., 1.00am
- Rewards: 2500 OCEAN for lowest error, 1500 for 2nd-lowest, 1000 for 3rd
- Rewards are calc'd & distr'd as part of DF ops
- Claim rewards in DF app

Are you ready to predict ETH price? With Challenge DF, competitions are weekly with 5000 $OCEAN in prizes.

The first competition is live now.

So sorry to hear about that.

You don't have ""write"" permissions in the treasure hunter channel 

All you can do is to use /apply command which will initiate the bot and then you have to answer some questions about Ocean Protocol

Thank you for spending your valuable time to read my feedback on the Ambasador program. Please take all criticism and sense for common sense purposes to improve the Ocean Protocol ecosystem and optimize all processes. 


First of all, as an Ambassador I am very happy to be in such a community and thank you all for your input. But, now to get to the point of this post:

Huge thanks to @blockchainlugano for the work done. This effort to introduce something new has really succeeded and the Ambassador program has been transformed. But in all new innovations there are also disadvantages:

1) Lack of tracking the work of other ambassadors (In a good way) I every person who is sensible analyzes some things. So while writing some content, I had difficulties in analyzing the topics that others wrote on so that there was no overlap.


2) Binding your wallet to the platform.
As you have seen in the community, many do not have the desire to connect their wallet to an unknown source. This does not prevent us from creating another wallet and using an ""empty"" one, but security is paramount!!!!

3) Incorrect distribution of responsibilities. I don't have information on internal operational aspects within the team. But it seems to me that almost most of the work is done only by @blockchainlugano  in Ambassador Programm. Maybe I'm wrong and underestimate other people's labor (but I'm judging purely from my own view). 

4) I propose to reformat the ambassador program next week. All ambassadors will write treads on one given topic and whoever dives deeper and hits the most important aspects is the OPF winner.",,,0.9604

With the upgrade of the ambasador program, there is a very large influx of users. This is good on both sides. But I'd like to only touch on the bad one: these people came here for money, which is not just handed out here. I do not want to strongly affect other people's personalities and suggest to reduce the number of ambassadors to a minimum (the most active) And make a decent pay (by the standards of the project). 


Perhaps I forgot to mention something in the moment of writing this post. But there is no growth without mistakes. And Ocean Protocol clearly has room to grow. All the best and all the best.",,,0.9528

It is super constructive and what the program aims for, which is being a community where everyone has a voice and contributes to its betterment.

As per #1 I have created a solution to this in a new document (link in ambassador channel and pinned) allowing everyone to post their work so that anyone can see what another has submitted.  Let me know if you feel this works.

As per #2, part of us wanting to reward contribution that we worked hard on with rep3 is for your work to go with you. Everything created has value, and we think it only fair that via your wallet address (of your choice) you should have a 'resume', otherwise there is no good way to verify your contributions in a decentralized manner. If the wallet address receives mOcean as payment, with Polygon gas fees, there is nothing stopping you from transferring to another wallet for security.

As per #4 we cannot give out a topic, this is up to the Ambassadors, we sometimes give guidelines if a new aspect of OPF has launched, but we prefer to leave the imagination open. Many past threads came out of nowhere, stuff even we hadn't thought of. The winner (s) is simply chosen by OPF. It's not, the best of the bunch wins (what if its all subpar?), but rather, the quality of writing and topic most valued by OPF to retweet.

As per #5, not everyone joining in will become ambassadors nor want to, they may want to simply feel part of a community and participate in simpler bounties. The onboarding process changed since you came in, and trust me, it is not so easy.

Hope that makes sense. We can continue this convo in the ambassador channel for others to weigh in.",,,0.9596

Someone on their new Discord told me that Fetch.ai fell victim to the same thing that apparently Ocean did: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/05/discord-admins-hacked-by-malicious-bookmarks/ . However, that peson was not part of the Fetch team, they have been copiously quiet so I can't be sure that it was the same thing (unless someone here knows).  Now that link say it took Ocean only 30 minutes to recover.  But according to Fetch ""On Saturday, 12th August 2023, our old Discord server was compromised. We are actively working to address this situation however progress is slower than we had hoped, owing to Discord support response times.""  https://fetch.ai/content-hub/article/new-discord-server .  Note, that article is dated August 16, so 4 days later, and still their Discord server is up and running by the scammers.  Now can someone at Ocean explain this line ""Fortunately for Ocean, Scavuzzo was able to reach the operator of the server that hosts the Discord channel, and have the channel’s settings reverted back to normal.""  How was that possible if everyone is booted as admins?  Who is this ""operator of the server"" that is referred that could be contacted to fix things?  Could Fetch have done the same thing?  Further, what does Ocean think about this ""progress is slower ... owing to Discord support response times"" excuse by Fetch.ai?",,,-0.4064

Interestingly, it seems like a similar attack approach was used. However, the reason behind our swift recovery can be attributed to a couple of factors. First off, our team is made up of fantastic members who are actively present on Discord, even during off hours (they're like Discord superheroes! 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️). Secondly, while an admin account was indeed compromised, it wasn't the super admin account. So, as soon as we got wind of the breach, the affected admin promptly altered the password, invalidated all access tokens, and our trusty super admin was quick to take control of the situation. 🛡️
I don't have the exact details on which fetch's Discord account was compromised, but if they had to seek help from Discord support, it's quite likely that their super admin account took the hit. That kind of breach can really put the brakes on recovery efforts.",,,-0.8576

On a side note, once ive released these 10 datasets, i’d like to apply to the shipyard for a grant to build functionality ontop of the marketplace and keep developping new datasets.

Whether that is a gooey for easier UI, or payment processing that accepts any currency and converts it to ocean on the backend, to remove friction for the UX, or other APIs etc..

I’d like to understand what Ocean has thought about so far, to improve the use of the marketplace, so i can take that into consideration.

There’s no rush on this. But i am wondering what to attend or who to talk to to get to know Oceans PoV",,ocean (1),0.7824

Just wanted to share that there is currently a ~15% arbitrage for anyone who wants exposure to veOCEAN through psdnOCEAN.

Wednesday is considered to be the most productive day of the week, I wish everyone good work and the realization of achievements!

Let's lighten it up with a great topic of conversation. With the tremendous development of artificial intelligence and data. 
Have you thought about such crucial themes today as 

> The significance of Cloud infrastructure
> 
> Cloud and Edge provide flexible data storage alternatives. Data can be accessed by authorized entities anywhere, anytime. It's like data has become its own entity, with endless possibilities.

>  Forms of data ( structured and unstructured) 
> 
> • Structured: Leading analytics tools have been designed and optimized for structured data that is stored in a consistent format in traditional or cloud-based storage, such as a SQL database.
> • Unstructured: This data takes many shapes and can be text, images, audio, video, or incredibly complex 3D models of buildings, consumer devices, engines, etc.

> Problems with unstructured data and  what cutting-edge solutions have Ocean 
> 
> Have you had any experience using :
> 
> • Challenge Data Farming (DF) to build models for crypto price predictions 
> 
> • C2D Private Docker Registry (to build AI/ML models by keeping data privacy intact and getting valuable insights) 
> 
> • Predictoor (make unstructured crypto data valuable and extract insights from it) 
> 

Making private/public data valuable - today`s mainstream in the development of data.

Highlights stuff that I may emphasize: 

• Very Up-to-date info about extracting value from tagged, accessible data using machine learning and artificial intelligence services

• Migrate data to the cloud for secure and accessible storage, enabling value and insights.

 https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/05/24/the-new-era-of-big-data/?sh=5a36c9495783

Summary: Despite the success of data analytics in recent years, we have only scratched the surface. Most tools focus on structured data, while unstructured data remains largely untapped. Unstructured data makes up 80% of enterprise data but has been limited by hardware constraints. We need to leverage the variety and flexibility of data in its natural format instead of forcing it into predefined models.",,🔥 (2),0.7993

First for this, you'll need to have a data set cleaned and formatted for use to train. Next, you'll be able to publish the asset to https://market.oceanprotocol.com/ to allow access, data token, and storage of the model (IPFS, url, graphQL, etc) - the latter to these steps will be up to you using the LLM, model training or inference and so forth",,,0.7177

👍🏾 Ok. Let’s say I have structured and cleaned tabular data in the following DataStructure. Let’s say 

user_name | comment | country_code | user_category | some_derived_tags

All are “string” data type. 

Imagine I have 50,000,000 records in total stored as one object in AWS S3. 
Do I treat the entire object (which is Bigdata to me) as one asset here?

How do I store them in their “encrypted” form using Ocean protocol? Choice of decentralized storage : IPFS at the moment, we may move to areweave in future. 

Pre-Trained  LLM models are on the internet. But I want to retrain on my custom data shown above and store the Model (encrypted form) for dAPP interactions. Please send me some docs to read and try hands-on. 

Thanks

My pseudonym is transhyprocrite.eth and I am interested starting a wiki to map out DAO's, such as Sushi Swap.

Few Q's just if anyone is kind enough to answer any of them whilst I dive deeper over the next few days! 
- what programming lang is used here?
- what sector of ai would you say you fall under? computing power/storage/oracle/ai agent etc? Maybe none of it, instead can maybe facilitate an array of ai protocols?
- was this fair launched?
- is there a burn mechanismh here?
- token inflationary or deflationary?
- is it possible to stake?
- where can i find info on team background?

Again I know it's quite extensive and plan to try figure all of this out over the next couple days, but any help to get me kick started would be greatly appreciated! Thanks 🙂",,,0.976

> Ocean Protocol supports multiple programming languages
> 
> JavaScript: Ocean.js is a JavaScript library used for interacting with the Ocean Protocol ecosystem.
> Python: Ocean.py is a Python library used for integrating applications with the Ocean Protocol ecosystem. 

> I think the above mentioned technologies have already captured most of the market. I think that in the next year will evolve - CRM AI systems will find sales opportunities, automate customer capture, predict demand, make product recommendations and guide the customer through the next steps to purchase.

> Ocean Protocol launched the Ocean Token in November 2017, alongside its Marketplace Framework which outlines the market attributes and components necessary to deploy the decentralized Ocean Protocol data exchange.
> 
> As i remember correctly at launch Ocean Protocol has Hard Cap —  hard caps by each phase — Seed, Pre-Launch and Network Launch

> Ocean token model:
> OCEAN is designed to increase with a rise in usage volume 
> - A rise in usage volume → leads to more network revenue, which goes to Ocean community via (a) burning OCEAN (b) other community initiatives
> - A rise in usage volume → leads to more OCEAN being locked

> OCEAN is actually deflationary as 5% of all network revenue is burned. This means OCEAN supply will decrease faster with greater adoption of the Ocean Protocol.

I have researched interesting solutions in recent times that will fundamentally change that narrative. 

AI for anti-money laundering (AML):

> Elliptic integrates AI to detect suspicious blockchain transactions and money laundering activities, increasing trust in crypto platforms.

Fraud detection with big data and AI:

> Binance uses real-time machine learning to uncover fraudulent transactions, reducing costs and human effort.

Using AI and blockchains for data validation:

> IBM and Walmart's ""Food Trust"" project combines blockchain technology and AI-based analytics to track supply chain databases and improve processes.

Challenges persist:

> Bitcoin dominance poses a challenge for non-Bitcoin projects during bear markets. Funding concerns and regulatory uncertainty affect the success of crypto projects. Reluctance from institutional players due to low regulatory clarity. Concerns about unethical aspects of AI marginalizing human innovation.

To have one less point of failure in the system. Ocean's vision has always been to slowly (but responsibly) move to a fully decentralised architecture, with ideally zero points of failure to make Ocean fully censorship resistant. 


However, this comes in little steps. And as the technology becomes more mature/robust, the more smart contract automation will be taking place. And more keys will be thrown away (hence also the multi-sig). 


This is what further enhance security and will eventually make Ocean fully community-owned, just like Bitcoin. No owners, but its community!

The amount of active rewards you receive can vary due to several factors beyond just the APY of the dataset you allocated to. Here are some potential reasons for the discrepancy:

1. Changes in Data Consume Volume (DCV): If the DCV for the dataset you allocated to has decreased, this could result in lower rewards despite a higher APY.
2. Changes in veOCEAN allocations: If other participants have allocated more veOCEAN to the same dataset, the rewards could be distributed among more stakeholders, reducing your share.
3. Changes in the total OCEAN locked: If there has been an increase in the total OCEAN locked, it could affect the distribution of rewards.
4. Variations in the OCEAN reward schedule: The total amount of OCEAN distributed as rewards can change, as outlined in the reward schedule.
5. Timing of allocations: The timing of when you allocate your veOCEAN can influence the rewards due to the progressive counting of voting power throughout the week.",,,0.9839

APYs are an estimate because they depend on both DF rewards and OCEAN locked.

OCEAN lock time greatly affects APY. The numbers assume that all locked OCEAN is locked for 4 years, so that 1 OCEAN → 1 veOCEAN.

For passive rewards, APY is highly dependent on the locked amount and duration of lock.

In other DF streams, there are other factors that affect APY.

APY could be much worse or better if you lock for shorter durations.

The OCEAN rewards you receive from delegating your veOCEAN to a predictoor asset in Volume Data Farming come from the Ocean Protocol's Data Farming incentives program. Specifically, in the context of Predictoor, 80% of prediction feed sales go to predictoors themselves, and a portion of the sales from prediction feeds is used to purchase prediction feeds, which includes the OCEAN allocated weekly to Predictoor Data Farming. This suggests that the rewards are not just from the total supply given by the foundation but are also generated from real yield coming from people who use the predictoor and purchase prediction feeds.

""Believe in yourself and your abilities. You are capable of more than you can imagine. Trust in your potential.""

""Stay focused, stay determined, and never give up. Your hard work will pay off, and your dreams will become a reality.""

""Take pride in the work you do. Your effort and dedication make a difference, and your contributions matter.""

(1) I understand by locking Ocean in veOcean, I could get rewards from data farming. But what exactly does veOcean if I not delegate my veOcean to datasets? What I mean is: by locking to veOcean is it simply giving the marketplace liquidity or?

And my second question is: (2). You read a lot of times about partnerships with Ocean or companys who make there own marketplace from Ocean's code. Does I as a investor in Ocean benefit from those marketplaces? Does there marketplaces use Ocean tokens to run? Or what is the benefit from company's who work with the by Ocean created marketplace 'layout'?",,,0.9486

1. By locking OCEAN to get veOCEAN, you are not simply providing liquidity to the marketplace. veOCEAN serves several purposes:

Passive OCEAN Rewards: Holding veOCEAN entitles you to passive OCEAN rewards every week.

Active OCEAN Rewards: Allocating veOCEAN towards data assets can earn you active OCEAN rewards weekly, based on the sales of the assets you support in the Ocean ecosystem.

Delegating: You have the option to delegate your veOCEAN to other Data Farmers who can curate datasets for you, potentially earning you APY on active rewards.

Publisher Stake Bonus: If you are a publisher, allocating veOCEAN to your own asset gives your veOCEAN a 2x bonus, incentivizing publishers to engage with their assets and benefit the Ocean ecosystem.

Locking OCEAN for veOCEAN is a commitment that aligns with the long-term incentives of the Ocean Protocol ecosystem. It is not just about providing liquidity but also about participating in the governance and curation within the Ocean Protocol's Data Economy.",,,0.9756

When companies create their own marketplaces using Ocean's code, the Ocean ecosystem can benefit in several ways. While these third-party marketplaces may use a different currency for transactions, if they are publicly accessible, indexable, and abide by the fee structure set out by Ocean Protocol, transaction fees would be remitted back to the Ocean community. These fees contribute to the ecosystem's revenue, which can support the buy-and-burn process of the OCEAN token, potentially reducing the supply and creating value for OCEAN holders.

Additionally, the usage of Ocean's open-source tech stack, even if transactions are paid in a currency other than OCEAN, still generates a small fee for the Ocean community with each consumed transaction. This fee accrues whether OCEAN is used or not, and the details are provided in the documentation.

The APY is influenced by various factors, including the amount of OCEAN locked, the duration of the lock, and whether the rewards are passive or active. Specifically:

APYs are estimates because they rely on both DF rewards and locked OCEAN.

The lock time of OCEAN significantly impacts APY, assuming that all locked OCEAN is secured for 4 years, converting 1 OCEAN to 1 veOCEAN.

For passive rewards, APY depends heavily on the locked amount and the duration of the lock.

Different DF streams may have other factors affecting APY.

APY could vary significantly based on the duration of the lock, being either worse or better.

The figures assume active allocation of veOCEAN towards high-DCV data assets.",,,0.9749

To stake OCEAN tokens, you can lock OCEAN and earn rewards via Ocean Data Farming. You can acquire veOCEAN by locking your OCEAN tokens in the Data Farming dApp, which allows you to vote on your favorite assets in the Ocean ecosystem. Passive Data Farming rewards are earned by locking OCEAN for veOCEAN for a period of time.

To lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, you can use the Data Farming dApp. The longer you lock OCEAN, the more veOCEAN you get, with a maximum lock period of four years for the highest rewards. After the lock period ends, you can withdraw your principal OCEAN tokens.",,❤️ (1),0.9493

Ocean Data Farming (DF) is an incentive program by Ocean Protocol that rewards participants with OCEAN tokens for engaging in activities that boost Data Consume Volume (DCV) within the ecosystem. Participants can earn rewards by locking OCEAN into veOCEAN, curating data, or making predictions. DF operates similarly to DeFi liquidity mining but is specifically tailored for DCV.

Ocean Predictoor is both a stack and a dapp designed for prediction feeds with accountability for accuracy through staking. It is globally distributed and resistant to censorship as it operates on-chain, and its accuracy is expected to improve over time due to its incentive structure. The initial use case for Ocean Predictoor is predicting DeFi token performance.",,,0.926

1) The websites are not at all intuitive; it really hinders the project. I visited the sites (I'm French) and I really didn't understand everything. It's something that needs to be conveyed to the frontend developers of the project to improve the user experience.

2) The documentation on Ocean Protocol is not clear enough (in my opinion). There is too much information all at once, and everything is a bit overwhelming. There needs to be more clarity in the instructional documents. By the way, I think a ""Links"" channel in the Discord server could be useful, where all the relevant links regarding Ocean Protocol can be shared.

3) It's not easy to grasp what Ocean Protocol does. The goals and the project need to be made clearer. Establishing a roadmap, for example, and focusing on one thing. Ocean is introducing a prediction system, which seems to deviate a bit from its original idea of providing DATA for AI companies and anyone in need of DATA, right?

4) The community and hype need to be rebuilt. Perhaps by organizing events, unlocking funds to attract new users, creating an engaged community. To help, you could lean on the crypto project: Monad. They have an excellent community and communication.

Is it possible to convey this information to the core team and work on it seriously? Otherwise, Ocean Protocol is a very promising project. I actually created a thread to present it, available here: https://x.com/Tom_crpt/status/1728828780288868747?s=20",,,0.9791

Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange protocol that enables individuals and organizations to share, sell, and consume data in a secure, transparent, and privacy-preserving manner. The protocol is designed to address the current challenges in data sharing, such as data silos, lack of interoperability, and data privacy concerns, using blockchain technology, smart contracts, and cryptographic techniques.

How are you?)

When you delegate your veOCEAN tokens to a dataset in Volume Data Farming (Volume DF), you are not providing liquidity but rather allocating your veOCEAN to data assets with high data consume volume (DCV). This is a form of data curation, as your veOCEAN allocation helps to signal the value of the data asset within the Ocean Protocol ecosystem. The more veOCEAN allocated to an asset, the higher its rank in terms of DCV, which can influence the distribution of OCEAN rewards from the Volume DF.",,,0.9612

The suggested solution is through the development and widespread adoption of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). The idea is to accelerate BCI technology, making it accessible to the general public (BCI/acc). The strategy involves creating compelling BCI applications, such as silent messaging, to generate demand and drive the evolution of BCI devices.

Predictions work with Ocean through the Ocean Predictoor, which is a stack and dapp for prediction feeds with accountability for accuracy via staking. Predictoors submit individual predictions and stake on them, earning money when they're correct and losing money when not. This incentivizes accurate prediction feeds. Predictoor is built on the Ocean Protocol stack and uses the Oasis Sapphire privacy-preserving EVM chain for keeping predictions private unless paid for.

1. The number of predictoor bots behind the USD-BTC 1H prediction is not disclosed to prevent potential exploitation and manipulation. The platform aims to show only trustable and secure metrics

The APY is influenced by various factors, including the amount of OCEAN locked, the duration of the lock, and whether the rewards are passive or active. Specifically:

APYs are estimates because they rely on both DF rewards and locked OCEAN.

The lock time of OCEAN significantly impacts APY, assuming that all locked OCEAN is secured for 4 years, converting 1 OCEAN to 1 veOCEAN.

For passive rewards, APY depends heavily on the locked amount and the duration of the lock.

Different DF streams may have other factors affecting APY.

APY could vary significantly based on the duration of the lock, being either worse or better.

The figures assume active allocation of veOCEAN towards high-DCV data assets.",,"✅ (8),❤️ (1)",0.9741

 1. Choose a bridge platform:

Binance Bridge: This is the official bridge supported by Binance. It's a convenient choice if you already use Binance and it offers competitive fees. However, be aware of potential network congestion on both chains.
Anyswap: Another popular option offering fast bridging and various supported chains, including BNB Chain and Ethereum. Consider their fees and potential liquidity for larger amounts.
Portal Bridge: A new bridge focused on interoperability, offering quick transactions and competitive fees. Do your research on its track record and community feedback before proceeding.
 2. Connect your wallet:

 Connect your wallet containing the OCEAN tokens on BNB Chain to the chosen bridge platform. Most bridges support popular wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Binance Chain Wallet.

 3. Select tokens and amount:

 Choose OCEAN as the token you want to bridge and specify the amount you want to transfer. Remember to check the minimum transfer amount and any network fees involved.

 4. Initiate the bridge transaction:

 Review the transaction details and confirm the bridge process. Depending on the platform, you might need to approve additional steps within your wallet.

 5. Wait for completion:

 The bridging process can take some time depending on network congestion. The platform should provide you with an estimated completion time and transaction tracking information.

 6. Claim your tokens on Ethereum:

 Once the bridge completes, your OCEAN tokens will be available on your chosen Ethereum address. Connect your wallet to the bridge platform or any Ethereum wallet connected to the same address to access your bridged tokens.",,✅ (1),0.9773

For those unfamiliar, Predictoor is a stack and dapp for prediction feeds that ensures accuracy through staking. It's globally distributed, censorship-resistant, and built on the Ocean Protocol stack.

To get started with Predictoor, follow these steps:

Begin by exploring the dapp at predictoor.ai.

Click on ""run bots"" and review the Predictoor or Trader README. The ""How to Earn"" section of the blog provides detailed information.

For Predictoors, if your prediction is correct, you earn money, but if it's wrong, your staked amount is slashed and distributed among those who made the correct predictions. While it's technically possible to predict without using bots, doing so manually for hundreds or thousands of submissions would be tedious and error-prone. Therefore, using a bot is the most practical approach.

For Traders, the confidence in a prediction can be assessed by the amount of OCEAN staked on it. The accuracy of Predictoor predictions over time depends on various factors, including historical price information and potentially other data sources like social media or news.",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/612953349003673629/1209066743243481128/IMG_8663.jpg?ex=65e59226&is=65d31d26&hm=d0f0845920afdf52a84db77e3e3a7677541f13af6653488de9b091627545df42&,,0.6049

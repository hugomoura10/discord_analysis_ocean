I believe there is a lot of good stuff coming that way, so I just wanted to be talking more about it in the public domain.

**Data Farming Page => Per-DataNFT APY**
    - APY, DCV & Current Allocation
    - Mainly comparing last week (what happened - fixed numbers) to this week (what's happening - variable numbers)
**Rewards Page => Round History => Passive + Active APY**
     - Passive Rewards has some cruxes to sort out (details being sorted out)
     - Active Rewards is more straight forward

No current plans for Leaderboards.
Some of the effort focuses on facilitating core intuition and your personal performance.
Some of the effort focuses on more macro intelligence.

What I would argue is that not all alerts and not all intelligence is premium.

Example: a stream of stakes, buys, etc... is not very actionable.

Imbalances between DCV and staked amounts are because this is where users can harvest most yield.

In the presentation I provided you, I have alluded to how to build a freemium model that converts users from free, into paying, by slowly increasing the friction and guiding them towards monetization.

Example of a previous arbitrage TG app...
--------
I made most buys/sells alert free. You could access many bot commands that helped users stay engaged and discover the app.

This facilitated the onboarding of thousands of users (no initial friction, more Daily Active Users), and keep them engaged (more user sessions).

However, alerts on arbitrage spreads (I.e. buy on dex1 and sell on dex2 for 5%) and other features were premium because this is where users make money.

This enabled me to obtain many more users (larger funnel due to no friction), while providing them towards a clear path of monetization (obvious value offering/conversion).

Many freemium products offer multiple SKUs (I.e. multiple token gates within a single freemium app). Each token gate (SKU) can be linked to a different feature/super power.

This is where understanding your users segments (different users, different goals) and how to build premium features (solving the customer problem for each segment) within a single freemium product, can lead to much larger revenue.

Hope this helps.",,,0.9839

You have a lock, now what you need to do is allocate the veOCEAN balance you have onto datasets you want to farm.

If you look on the left panel in the veOCEAN page, you should see information about your lock, when it will expire, and your veOCEAN amount.

If you go to the page with all the assets, and on the top left you will see an exclamation mark.

Red Exclamation => You don't have any veOCEAN
Yellow Exclamation => You have veOCEAN but haven't allocated your voting power to any assets
White Exclamation => You have allocated your veOCEAN (as a percentage 0/100%) to different assets and are now actively farming rewards.",,,0.9289

The volume isn't being taken out.

Right now, the market rewards participants who wash consume because fees & rewards are not balanced.
With ranking and fee adjustments, this will become even more competitive in terms of finding an edge as the gap closes.

You are right, now the easiest way to see If a dataset is a good quality one is to check the last rounds APY and predict that it could work well on current round as well.

- Look at the content of the dataset, is it a good one, does it have good demand in the future?
- Look at the publisher. If the dataset has been published by a trusted publisher and the publisher has other good datasets you can presume that the dataset is a good quality one and has more chances to be consumed.

Effect Network can be used to build datasets with human workers who get paid for completing each tasks in EFX. We're planning a hackathon on DoraHacks with the theme this time around being about creating datasets useful for AI. 

For example, I'm working on a project that collects all NFT's on EOS, downloads their images, and then uses HuggingFace models to generate a caption for them. Then I throw this all into a Search interface that uses ElasticSearch. The idea I have is if you use five different models to generate captions for NFT's you can have workers rate each model 1-10. With enough data you can figure out which models are best for captioning NFTs. You could also generate a lot of good data for potential reinforcement learning down the line for those models too. 

Do you think there is any interest for some collaboration between Ocean Protocol and Effect Network for Effect's hackathon? The general idea would be that participants will build Effect Network programs that generate datasets and the datasets then would be posted to Ocean Protocol's marketplace. If there's interest, let me know who I can contact to set up a connection between them and the Effect Network team.",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/993954438790258879/1098414844442587246/image.png?ex=65dfd90a&is=65cd640a&hm=5c4298c8df31b041f02b29fca0cfa4e2d78d004668dc3ebbded88f79859881a4&,,0.9531

There is no start rating inside the Marketplace, but I guess you are referring to good quality assets. In the marketplace there are 2 sections, one for highest veOCEAN allocations and one for Most sales, you can look in there for good quality assets.( be aware that this doesn't include the Predictoor assets which are on Oasis network )
An easier way to identify good quality assets is to go to data farming app and inside the Volume-DF page there is a table with assets you can allocate to, and you can identify good quality assets by sorting on high consume volume and APY and make sure this numbers are consistent over multiple rounds.",,,0.9834

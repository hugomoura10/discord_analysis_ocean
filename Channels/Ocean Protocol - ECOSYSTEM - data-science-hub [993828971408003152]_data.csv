**Introducing the Ocean Data Bounty**
Helping data providers to package, price and market their data.

With the latest version of Ocean Protocol — OceanONDA V4 live, we are announcing a new initiative to accelerate the adoption of Ocean as the orchestration layer for Data and AI. The Ocean Data Bounty program seeks to expedite the shift into a New Data Economy by incentivising data-driven insights and the building of algorithms on datasets geared toward solving complex business challenges.

The following blog post gives an overview of:

1) Ocean’s vision driving the program
2) Ocean bounty phases
3) Expected process and benefits.

The Ocean x Dimitra Data Challenge Phase 2 is now LIVE 🚀

This strategic challenge incentivises data analysis and the building of algorithms to harness the power of agricultural data for global change 🧑‍🌾

🎯 The objectives:

1. Rank the factors that affect yields and build a simple model to predict yields based on the features.

2. Identify and explain any trends in the yields over the 10 year period.

🏆The total prize pool is $10,000 USD (payable in OCEAN + DMTR)

1st place:                    $4,000
2nd place:                  $3,000

Many of you have been regularly participating to the Ocean Data Challenges and providing valuable feedback on how to improve the process as well our internal libraries. 

We have listened! As some of you have requested, I'd like to announce and extend my invite to you all of you here to join our first closed Alpha release of Desights.AI: https://desights.ai/ - the new data competition platform by @Manan and built using Ocean’s technology. 

For now, access to Desights AI is via invitation only. Desights AI will be the go-to platform for all Ocean Data Challenges and partner challenges in the future, starting from Predict ETH 3 that just went live on Monday. You can check it out here - https://desights.ai/shared/challenge/1

The long-term objective is to provide a simplified decentralised platform that handles ML ops for you while you control the ownership and get paid royalty for your creations. This platform will also facilitate you to socialise with like minded individuals and co-create with them. 

If you are interested in joining and want to claim your invite, enter their Discord (https://discord.com/invite/uBhKRmQ5H6) and ask @Manan for an invite.

This challenge is all about retention and activity in DeFi protocols. We're looking for data scientists and researchers to help us understand how users interact with a given protocol. By scraping data from a DeFi protocol, you can help us identify the best protocol practices and improve the user experience for everyone.

The challenge is open to anyone with experience in data science or research. Participants will compete for a $5,000 prize pool and their work will be showcased via Ocean Protocol.

Participate in the challenge today and help us make DeFi better for everyone!

For our recent challenge above themed for fantasy football performance, there seemed to be an issue in downloading the dataset for the given challenge.

I can assure you now that the data set can be downloaded, link: https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:6fd1ff2e2d59b89c610b2bf72f3f19b3fccb79864b019b63041a19b9010c9a5c?utm_source=om&utm_medium=om&utm_campaign=om

Read your guide on fine-tuning LLMs with Ocean Protocol—spot on for the future of web3 and AI!

Get ready for a shameless plug: Noticed you talked about wallet prerequisites like Metamask with some Matic and USDC. Here's a thought: what if it was easier for everyday people to be FELT customers? Think about how that could scale your user base beyond just the crypto crowd.
I'm one of the minds behind Punch. We're not just another wallet; we're a wallet and payment provider bridging the gap between banks and blockchains, and we come with a set of utility features you won't find elsewhere. 

Based in Europe? Punch could be a solid add-on to your offering.

Here's the gist on how you could work with Punch:

Quick and Dirty: Set your wallet to accept EURe (tokenized EUR) and add a ""Download Punch Wallet to Pay in EUR"" button at FELT's checkout.

Sleek and Clean: Integrate Punch Wallet directly into FELT. Needs a few lines of code, so a bit more elbow grease but a seamless experience for your users.

The kicker? Punch isn't just a wallet; it's a bank account and an Ethereum account in one. No traditional off-ramps here—just a simple transfer from your wallet to your bank or the other way around.

Got a Punch business wallet? Move your EURe to any of the 3,500 European banks at a 1:1 rate instantly, zero cost.

Intrigued? Send me a DM to dive into those unique features I mentioned, or find me on LinkedIn

Cheers,
Daniel",,,0.7965

You can see the final standings on Desights. The scores shown are not entirely correct. They should be multiplied by (4x) to get final tally. We're still refining on-chain scoring, but we'll sort it quickly. 

Please note that late submissions were penalized and that is reflected in the final scoring. Late submissions are no longer permitted and starting now data challenges will no longer be extended. This is all happening on-chain now, so it is important to submit correctly and on time via Desights.

We're working on a solution to pay prizes via Desights, without the need for you to invoice Ocean Protocol.

This challenge focuses on analyzing global carbon emissions using two datasets: Greenhouse Gas and Fossil CO2 emissions, covering country-specific and sector-specific data. It aims to apply AI/ML for predictive analysis and share findings on web3 platforms. Participants will explore the impact of data science on climate policy and predictions, grouping results by continents for a comprehensive understanding.

This exploration will not only enhance our understanding of current emission patterns but also foster innovative approaches to mitigate climate change. The project will offer a unique opportunity to contribute to global environmental efforts by leveraging cutting-edge technologies in data science and AI, while also emphasizing the importance of collaborative research and shared knowledge in addressing one of the most pressing issues of our time.

Just a heads up - we noticed some submissions in the last challenge on Desights looked pretty similar, like they might be from the same person or group using different accounts. These entries didn't really hit the mark on quality, so they won't be getting the Bonus reward (Reviewers' decision).

It's better to put your energy into making one really good submission rather than a bunch of so-so ones. Not only does this improve your chances of winning the bigger prize 💰 , but it also keeps your rep solid (this reputation will be helpful in coming challenges and especially leaderboard).

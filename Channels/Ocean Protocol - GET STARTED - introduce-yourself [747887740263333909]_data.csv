Hi everyone, my name is Tom but more widely known as **endro labs** (https://endro.io) in the cryptospace. I am from a small country called Belgium and got to know Ocean via Dimitri when BigChainDB was still the main focus! My daily endeavours are at Lisk community but i'm also trying to take on bits and pieces in the Polkadot community. My development activities are currently **Arcado Network**, a decentralized gaming environment where the main drive would be to try and bring the world from Ready Player One to life! Some might also know me from **Hallar** (https://hallar.io) which is the meeting ground for future networks and validators for DPOS consensus. The platform is currently targeted at the Lisk Ecosystem but would love to expand it in the future. 

Starting next week, i will be starting as a full-time crypto roamer so hit me up if you want to connect or just have a fun chat 😄 I also have experience with AI as a service (Google, FastAPI, NLP engines, Tensorflow, ..) so hit me up if you need some help or info regarding AI or Blockchain",,"💯 (2),👍 (4),💪 (1)",0.972

the ocean wallet on bittrex has been inactive for weeks. my tokens were not withdrawn successfully, yet they have not been restored to my bittrex wallet either. Bittrex says they can't do anything until the wallet is back online and they made it sound like it was on the Ocean team to get it fixed, and to only check back when it's online but they did not give any timeline.

Not a `blockchain` expert but am working on techniques to bridge between distributed application logic and `smart contract` functionality.

I studied `OceanProtocol` vision and high level design material quite a bit but not yet knowledgeable enough. If you think am missing some point please point me to material that I need to study.

Based on my understanding so far I do have some premises on how my work & focus relate to `OceanProtocol`. 
One of my first goals is to verify those premises with people here and their experiences.

My name is Eduardo and I'm part of the Polkadot Brazilian Team.

I saw several posts on Trello about the Ocean Protocol and got interested in knowing more.

I am initiating contacts to structure a project proposal for a DEFI Tolkens Exchange for the Brazilian market and probably LATAM.

One of the things I would like to develop would be market monitoring robots. With the ability to understand graphic patterns and times to make asset purchase and sale decisions. In addition to arbitration for Flash Loan contracts.

I don't know if that is exactly your focus and I would like to confirm. If so, I believe that this would bring great advantages to our project. And that is the reason for this contact.

My name is David Hunt-Mateo and I'm a software engineer with 7 years of professional experience. For the last three years, I developed a cross-platform, on-device, noise-robust speech recognition library. Users liked it because it would work on whatever hardware they had, it never transmitted their audio to the cloud, and it would work in harsh environments like the middle of the ocean or a noise manufacturing floor. Unfortunately, I was laid off at the end of 2020. Soon after, I began reading about blockchain and was immediately enthralled by the benefits that decentralized Web 3 technologies could bring. I am currently participating in the KERNEL Block 2 fellowship program hosted by Gitcoin. 

I've spent 4 weeks researching to understand the Web 3 landscape and to determine exactly what use cases excited me most. I determined that I am most passionate about the user's right to privacy and data ownership, especially regarding AI and communication. Having developed a production AI system myself, I'm familiar with the massive amounts of data required as well as the difficulties small companies face when trying to acquire data. Furthermore, it's not hard to recognize the tactics that larger companies employ to extract data from their users. I think the Ocean Protocol could provide a solution to these problems, and furthermore, that it is poised for massive growth as the mainstream consciousness becomes aware of the abuse it's suffered at the hands of big tech. 

As such, the Ocean Protocol tops the list of projects I'd like to become involved with. My career has meandered through several industries and many layers of the technology stack. I consider myself a jack of many trades, adept at learning/applying new technologies, and a skilled communicator. My specialties in the past have been cross-platform development, desktop and native Android apps, and embedded software.",,"👍 (2),👏 (2)",0.8975

Additionally it also enables the creation of datatokens and liquidity pools for datasets which allow for price discovery, curation and reputation of datasets. High quality datasets will have different setups of their datatokens than unsuccessful ones.",,"👏 (3),👍🏻 (1)",0.7075

In Ocean Protocol the data is not stored on the blockchain but the governance is organised via the blockchain. So the data resides on premise and the access to the data by algorithms is organised via compute-to-data. This means that the data is not going to leave the data storage and that the data owner (you) can allow algorithms to access the data or not.",,,0.5457

It is an honor to e-meet you. 

I recently completed the OCEAN Academy and I officially became Ambassador 🙂 

I am a Swiss student pursuing a Master in Big Data (at IE University, Spain) and I am currently working at the investment startup Goldfingr (goldfingr.net) as a Business developer. 

I am very intrigued in the Ocean Protocol’s current challenges and on how we can make the company grow, together! I am willing to actively be engaged in the ‘visibility / marketing’ side of the business. 

I work with a Swiss Blockchain enthusiast and we would be thrilled to jump on a call to tell you more about our us and share insights. We recently worked on the elaboration of a WhitePaper and a crypto platform launch. I sincerely believe we can add-up new skills and ideas to the team.

I am hoping that any of you will be able to bring me guidance on the current and future steps to get involved in revolutionary OCEAN Protocol! We are open to discuss anything and start working ASAP!

Looking forward to collaborating with you.

Sincerely, 
nicolas.marechal@student.ie.edu",,,0.9758

My name is Rik Rapmund, supporter of Ocean since the ICO and founder of WorkPi: an HR Tech startup that predicts the required skills for rapidly evolving jobs in organisations to reduce skill gaps and eliminate mismatches. Besides WorkPi we are also building Work X: a decentralized platform economy for work where service providers and customers can work together without intermediaries. 

Because we believe that the personal data of our users should be owned and controlled by themselves, we are working together with the European Commission on a Self-Sovereign Identity solution (SSI). Users will be able to connect their career related data such as assessments, diplomas, certificates or references to their digital passport/identity. This is also where Ocean comes along. It's a great thing to give data back to the people, but is also comes with a challenge: how do we learn from it when the data is scattered around the world? The technology of Ocean is very promising to solve this problem. To this end we introduce *Compute-to-SSI*. Learn more about our proposal here: https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/workpi-oceandao-round-9/862

For more than three years, I have worked in the social entrepreneurship sector, both academically and in the field. In addition to this, I also did works such as design, project management, marketing and etc. My interest in crypto is not new. I have been in this industry for 2 years. I like Ocean as a project and I think it's open. I'm here because I want to be a part of this community and improve myself here.

As a note: If you need help with Turkish translation, I can help the team voluntarily. Turkish is my native language and as an independent research, I have published various articles (academic) and documentations in this language. Do not hesitate to contact if you are interested.

I am currently toying with the idea of tokenizing the titles into an ERC-721Storage which would allow them to be brought on-chain.

Maybe consider joining our weekly Town Halls. It's always Wednesdays, 3pm UTC. We celebrate teams and accomplishments there, next to DAO specs and updates, and we have an open floor at the end of every Town Hall where new members and contributors often say Hi (and link with new co-builders or projects):
 https://discord.gg/WHZePqBs?event=966678382664384572

Also, since I see you got some nice NFT design game going as well, it's worth checking if there are projects working with NFTs, also towards dataNFTs, at the moment. 

Again easiest way here is to say Hi in Ocean-DAO channel (above), or, to go to the Ambassadors Channel, with @zippy1979, @blockchainlugano and others,  and ask them for a nice project to contribute to /collab with wrt NFTs. Top of my head this would be projects like Walt.ID, TheDataShift, WeDataNation, RealDataWhale, but definitely more.

Our tech was built by Streamr Network and we are currently in the process of raising funding to build our own team and focus on what is best for the Ecosystem of Data Unions. 

We had a call this week with one of the grant recipients from Ocean DAO who are looking to utilise the price discovery feature of the Ocean Marketplace. One of their remarks was that we currently do not offer anything regarding algorithms. I would like to explore this field and Ocean's technology to see what value add we could give to our DUs by integrating with Ocean Protocol. 

Would it be possible to meet someone from the Ocean Protocol team to have an introduction call?",,🍻 (4),0.891

I am freelancing as a Data Scientist & Technical Writer and would like to move into Blockchain / DAO analysis. Currently, I am looking for gigs in the space. 

So far, my closest job was a recent project where I analyzed arbitrage transactions on Terra on data from Flipside Analytics. Since then, that project has 'stopped' 😅. 

Before that, I played a bit around with blockchain data on BigQuery. I wrote up a few articles about that: https://medium.com/@nocibambi.

In the long term, I would like to produce insights and data products that blockchain projects / DAOs can use. I am especially interested in contribution management, governance, and ownership. However, at the moment, I am happy to contribute in any way (e.g., writing documentation).

It would be nice to hear any tips that might help me to take off, but especially the following:
- Common data/analytics challenges blockchain projects face in this space need to address urgently or in the long term.
- Current opportunities
- Other people/organizations I should reach out to",,,0.926

```let me know your idea and if DAO is OK with it bring it in and going on...```
My goal is to help build all the channels you and others need to succeed! 🙌 

I'd recommend sharing your proposal additionally in: #project-guiding, #✨︱find-a-team-old, #🗳︱ocean-dao

My recommendation is generally for people to collaborate. #✨︱find-a-team-old is undervalued. Feedback is only as good as the people contributing on the project.

1. We are looking for technical/strategic support to explore adoption/implementation/grant-application of Ocean Protocol (or similar DAO) for our startup (developing the world's first personal safety barometer - just launched our Reg CF campaign):  https://wefunder.com/safe-esteem
2. We believe our business and mission represent the quintessential application of the DAO Economy and Compute-to-Data Architecture: We are creating (and have a patent for) a universal personal life risk scoring system (accidents, crime, health). Think of it as the FICO score of life risks - but owned by each individual (instead of credit rating firms) who can participate in the larger market/economy of brokers, insurers et al, while preserving privacy and allowing increasingly sophisticated risk (and safety) models. 
3. I just used an adapted version of the Ocean Compute-to-Data Architecture graph for remarks at the United Nations Climate and SDG Synergies Conference https://www.un.org/en/climate-sdgs-conference-2022/page/side-events (with very clear attribution) to highlight the opportunities of a DAO/NFT approach to risk data (I hope the Ocean folks won't be upset - it was a last opportunity - happy to coordinate on the next event.

if anyone has more detailed resources to share, i'd be grateful for anything. and if AI tutoring sounds like an interesting problem to you, let's chat about it!! i've been deep down the web3 rabbithole for the past ~2 years so i'm getting back up to speed with the recent advances in transformer-based models. i'd love to meet anyone who wants to jam on ideas around how this ml pipeline could work. thanks ✌️",,"❤️ (2),🙌 (2),🤩 (2)",0.9883

With regards to labeling and human-in-the-loop, it might be interesting to see how DataUnion structured their operational model.

I read the white paper and watched some videos but I fail to understand two things:

- if data is ""hidden"" behind a certain URL, how exactly is a ""client"" reading the data without getting aware of this URL? Or is he getting the URL? If so what hinders him to re-visit this URL at any time in the future? Will the URL stay hidden for ever? If so:  who is accessing the URL on behalf of the client?

- if I (as a ""client"") have bought a data token, what hinders the publisher to take down his data? This would make my bought data token worthless. Do clients simply have to trust that publishers do not take down assets? 

Would be great if you could provide some reference for clarification.",,,0.7603

A use case is for example, a user creates a workspace and want to write a book with the support of a LLM lets say gpt 4, so he starts to explain  whats about and then he starts to mark the most suitable answer and save the outcome in his workspace.  The problem with common LLMs is that the context get lost if your token size is limited. therefore the system should keep the context intactand if the user asks lets say in chapter 22 about Kreig, the system should get the context and based on that the user can continue his progress...This is only a use case, but you can rely this pattern in different scenarios, for example code snippets from LLMs ai prompts to an entire project",,,0.4019

I've been lurking for about a year, while the rest of my life slowed down. I am able to focus and I want to align myself with someone more experienced who might be interested or benefit from what I am doing.  

I am self directed, but having a stable point of communication helps things develop.  Even if it is an overly critical, difficult personality. (sigh)  So don't think you won't help. 

My ultimate goal is a data processing project, that will help prepare data for the Ocean Protocol (or whatever) for AI consumption. I have details and fun reasons. I have 25 years of on and off programming experience, but only shortly in SWD - 99% in Business or research (social network analysis) and large scale data engineering/DevOps problems. Lots of experience with data collection.  

I am looking to gather people around me who would like to talk about this project in more detail, but specifically, I want to gain the interest of an older student/teacher, who will be comfortable communicating consistently, and being my point of contact on this discord. 

If anyone would like assistance from me, I would like to help, but I know zero at this point. I am willing to write a 'how to guide' as I do this. 

This is Elvis entering the building. Sorry for the loud entry.",,,0.988

~~Been working with a project recently that is building solutions for verifiable data & compute for decentralized AI training models. Would love to connect with the team to talk about how this could collaborate with what Ocean is doing!~~ nevermind I just found out you guys are already connected through OV, but would be happy to discuss it with someone anyway if interested!",,,0.954

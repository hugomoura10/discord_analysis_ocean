It remains a fragment, as it was publicly on twitter. 

It ends with a question: How to connect A) and B), accomplishing I)-IV)?

The answer I didn't give in the thread, but is is clear imo, is: use data NFTs (and datatoken) to bridge the gap.

As in: turn current NFTs into data NFTs (easiest V1 hack by Trent: just mint and ADD a data NFT on Ocean Market into the same wallet as the OG NFT, perform ""validation"" of legitimacy by checking if both NFTs are in the same address, also re: @realdatawhale our talk). 

Apply all possible web3 newdataeconomy functionality from data nft per user AND/OR Union (datatoken, APIs, data streams, etc., your magic):

Well said, Whale, also, well asked, Robin. üôÇ I think this might be the most intriguing time for Ocean buidl hands down: Close to major feature release, mainstream adoption still pending, dots coming together, great builders assembled. 

Like: 
Remember what I discussed with both of you by now? Also what I shared as experimentals in micro-blog threads? Roughly: Ocean Market as hub for dataPFPs / NFT -> dataNFT + datatoken?

I personally cannot commit too much time to this till Q3/Q4 (core prios/responsibilities), but my gut tells me, with your brain power combined, and a few new players like The Data Shift or WeDataNation in Ocean town, ""retail adoption/mobile apps/dapps/good stuff for regular #web3 humans"" magic might be right around the corner. We only need to lift the treasure. With the current NFT traction and dataNFT coming, you could turn this into smth truly beautiful, when combining forces.",,‚ô•Ô∏è (1),0.97

What IF, in Alga (or else), I NOT ONLY:
-  view, manage, trade, and evtl. stake (on) datatoken,

but I ALSO:
- manage ""my"" dataPFP, 
- browse #Web3 in it (built-in browser like Metamask today), 
- log into services with my Ocean dataNFT (compare: Twitter Blue, but also Opensea, rarity trackers, etc.) and, 

- - that's where we would start to differ/go further: 
- also manage my own data and licenses in it, like: 
- datatoken per dApp-class (social, trading, mobility, etc., ), 
- manage which data I want to share with which platform OR platform-class
- manage your sub-licenses (no further explanation for now, talk to RDW/Mo), 
- basically all ""my"" personal data-sets/datatoken, just like 
- my ""participation"" in Data Unions / ""full-bundle data sets of, say, 2 million social media users""?

I think none of you could build all of this alone, but I think you could do it together, where different entities could contribute different perspectives / skill-sets / superpowers. 

This would all be up to YOU from here :), but rough thinking would be:

- RealDataWhale = dApp/mobile App skills, community
- DataUnion = dApp skills PLUS Data Union skills, as in: what makes the most valuable data SETS, on micro (individual) and on macro (aggregated , compare above: 2 million social media users) level
- The Data Shift = ""GenZ"" NewDataEconomy Narrative / storytelling skills (compare: data decoder, e.a.), NFT/Mint/Whitelist-Skills, Twitter/Discord strong
- WeDataNation = Also around Millenial/GenZ narrative, with stronger Data Union focus and background, complementary, yet also slightly different from The Data Shift, European focus (both just fuzzy allocation, contintents, but important)
- DataLatte = experienced in the field of creating self-service tools for data supply from retail platforms, Netflix
- FELTtoken = deep machine learning <-> compute to data skills, as in: what would be the most valuable/efficient data-APIs for eg social media platforms in this example?",,‚ô•Ô∏è (1),0.9793

This is ALL out in the open, #Web3 style, as we DO play a positive sum game here - FOR A CHANGE -, so I would rely on you beautiful folks to sync on this concept if you feel it is valuable enough, and, ideally, include everyone who is interested. That's the only way we can succeed. Everyone contributes what he knows and does best, all opinions are respected equally, as we are all great builders imo, even for being here and granted. üòâ

For example: without the right APIs for platforms, this won't work (e.g. Felt, also Lynx/Algovera imo). Then: to get retail traction, a multi-""channel"" approach works best, hence: I'd love you to include all 3 retail facing supply GUI players like TDS, WDN and Latte in this. Also: without the experience of what makes the most valuable data sets (/Data Unions), this won't work. And so forth. Happy building and keep me in the loop! üòò",,,0.9947

1.) I am sorry for just throwing this in front of your feed while this could be a complete concept of its own, potentially powerful. Yet, since Ocean Protocol is as big and universal as it is, this is STILL one vertical, one way of bridging where we are at with our Tech as Ocean Protocol and where the crypto space is at.

2.) This is still the best I could do, given the big roadmap OPF has in front of it. So by making it a combined, but still an ""integration layer"" effort in the ecosystem, I hope that this concept can prosper and create great data supply and demand for Ocean Protocol, while I can still focus on my core tasks at hand and not disappoint either the brilliant visionaries in the team (way greater than me) or the community (both Ocean and DAO)

3.) This is a first in OceanDAO land, afaik. So please treat it as such: it is NOT a core OPF project or effort. It's experimental by me, Wally. I applied my old ecosystem hat thinking from my work in GSMA with Google, Telekom AT&T, etc.

In a different world and time, I would have made this the core strategy flagship, a ""speedboat"" as they call it. But those times, enterprise, are luckily over! 

In Ocean,  our roadmap is so packed (you know it), I would only have had greenlight to look at this full focus in Q3, but I was so afraid it would be too lated by then. 

SO we do a compromise, Web3 style. I am kickstarting a positive sum game by handing over all my thoughts and the hat over to you instead. The brilliant builders in OceanDAO land. So as always: be open, be supportive, don't own or hide ideas, rather share them openly (10x better) and build components legostyle that work together, towards a first lean, then continously improved UX, also define limits where your bandwidth is exceeded, in general: make us proud, web3 style, hand in hand. üåä‚òØÔ∏èüôå

I will try to come in here, consult, and help develop ideas, but I cannot promise anything. Hope that's ok w/ you.",,,0.9978

When you guys get there, you will be looking around for NFT PFPclubs (like BAYC) that have similar mechanics than the OG BAYC to partner with for a pilot, as in: 
- loyal community, 
- adored art, 
- the desire and drive to grow the club and add utility to the NFTs 
- great trait-structure (smiles, hats, etc.) 

That's why I, as a former journalist, spent weeks (at night times mostly) in different NFT PPFclubs, initially to understand the dynamics. 

The best candidate I could find is @LilBabyApeClub. They were one of the most anticipated NFT launches last year, with staking already live (Lilbanana), and a strong community, with some initial growing pains. The club is legit, I spent, as said, weeks in there, and the growing pains will very soon be resolved. I'm in contact with the community lead and will make the contact as soon as our POTENTIAL collab-pilot/proto would be ready for it.",,‚ô•Ô∏è (1),0.9752

It is all documented above, but the main trigger would be enriching current NFTs towards a dataNFT, pulling your personal data that result from you using a platform after you logged into it with your dataPFP (defining APIs here as well, hence adding FELT), just like offering the platforms you log into with your NFT the ability to pull data from your former/past e.g. social media actions / usage of platforms to enrich their on-site experience for you.

As I was saying to Malte, fact shows that we are VERY late for the NFT hype right now, and BAYC dropping in FP is creating instability in the space. However, a new recent trend (healthier for us too) could be ENS.

I was in a Spaces with ENS founder @avsa and he was saying how overwhelmed the team was about this recent community-driven effort (referring to the 10k club) and so to further drive adoption of ENS (and revenue) they are considering creating the tools to allow the creation of different ""NFT collections"" within the ENS ecosystem. (10k club, 100kclub, 3letters club, 24h club)

The ENS ecosystem will probably kick off the growth of different collections the same way we saw with OpenSea - in which each collection has their stewards + utlity sort to speak. This is not directly related to Data, but a trend to hook on perhaps.

Lots to discuss and not a clear direction yet, but I agree that PFPs will have stronger utility and could help OP/DataNFTs gain more exposure.",,,0.9876

Clarifying:
- This is not a working group
- This is not related to the core Ocean roadmap
- The purpose is rather to ""play"" or experiment with the concept of data NFTs 
- This is NOT scope of V4, but it can be built ON TOP of V4 (if you like to)
- This is an early experimental concept of mine that Trent kindly greenlighted üôè to be put out there early, when it started trending (PFP NFT as ID) 
- This is for everyone to see and to potentially collaborate on it (Web3 style, positive sum game, no secrets)
- We would love for everything that could result from this to lead to data supply and demand on Ocean Market (and we think Ocean is the best toolset for this)
- I will not steward or lead this channel
- I will come in and say Hi when core tasks allow for it
- This is an open ""meet, chat, exchange ideas, collaborate on them"" kinda room
- And a ""reader"" for the experimental concept for everyone
- Nothing more

Enjoy this early experiment, and take it from here. If things progress and we see interest in this topic, we reserved a potential roadmap item for this in Q4, so we could swag it up for and with you and build infra around it, if we all feel it is worth the invest of energy and time.

This is possible using datatokens and wouldn't require the data nft owner to relinquish control of the data nft. When creating the datatoken, specify the `timeout` to be the number of seconds that a given order is valid for. The dataset or algorithm can then be consumed or used for compute-to-data as many times as the consumer wants until the timeout is reached.

> Or to try monetize the data on your behalf?
I could imagine a professional service that runs ocean infrastructure on behalf of a data publisher. This would certainly require some off-chain coordination and trust, but could still be accomplished using datatokens. The datatoken's `service_endpoint` could point to a provider instance run by the ocean infrastructure provider.  The infrastructure provider would collect provider fees while the data nft owner collects order fees.",,,0.8248

As a DAO launching a fork of Ocean Market we're running into some community concerns about  a potential ""staking rush"" of people making claims of data ownership & profiting off them when there will definitely be contested claims down the road. Some potential solutions included using verifiable credentials or decentralized identity solutions but there is still a missing link between the IP-NFT and the real world assets (not data) associated with them.

""*How to balance PFPclub/project control over copyright*s

*PFP NFT holders monetizing on their art via copyright/licensing deals,* 
like lending out for music videos, openings, movies, etc.""

Here's a manual example. This could be much more elegant, automated (and auto generating token incentives). Via:

Enrich each ""Character"" with a backstory, stories, preferences, basically needed details to use the whole ""Character"", potentially allowing partners to add on these (what Ape experienced in TV Show Episode X), getting royalties.

No need to anonymize really. For you to reach out to them, and to understand the potential. PLUR is tailored for 3D high res, and will be part of a Metaverse Game, coming out Q1 2023.

While the final goal here would be to actually mint profile pic NFTs as data NFTs, have full Ocean funct (data sets, datatoken, agreements, sublicenses, payments) on-board from day one, 

there's a second line of thinking (from Trent) 
- Carry second NFT (data NFT) as license card,
- Named after Art/PFP NFT (eg PLUR #1477 License NFT), 
- Held in wallet with PFP NFT
- Proof-of -authenticity, beyond single CNM (Central NFT Marketplace) Auth API 
- Attach sub-licensing to License data NFT via data sets -> data token
- Partners buy data token to access license X,Y,Z of ""Character"" #1477 for A weeks.

Collaborators I see going after that (not limited to those ofc;
@realdatawhale (strong biz outreacher / great connections)
@Sam  (TDS working on data NFT as PFP long term vision)
@Dave - TDS (TDS working on data NFT as PFP long term vision)
@dudeAmir | datalatte (NFT x data monetization x data science Ocean OG)
@Phil (walt.id) (Enterprise-grade backend for data NFT as DID for e.g. login)


Closing:
- Potential low hanging fruit.
- data consume is the name of the game
- None of this requires enhanced AI/ML-work
- ""first step automate"" current manual dilemma (paper license agreements are cringe in PFP land)
- first cut would include: 
- data NFT as license card 
- purchase datatoken with URLs for license T&C, agreements
- add more complex (levels) of license management over time
- make consume as seamless as possible
- with strong/fun/minimal dapp for this
- incl. mint license data NFT and simp licenses to be purchased, I guess
- (latter ofc up to builders)

This organization has begun to develop its system of governance of these open standards, and Athena Protocol is leading the Engineering Circle, helping to bring adoption of Ocean Protocol Tools and softwares. Our work creating signed claims and comments for the ocean stack has prepared us to compose our middleware's into a data transaction and verification layer capable of conducting audits and certifying ecosystem services. We have a list of organizations planing to integrate with our middleware. 

One organization Im very excited to announce in particular participating in the integrations is the Regen Network !

I am currently trying to publish an asset in a local dev environment (I got barge working to the extend neccessary) and have followed the docs on how to use ocean.js to do so to the best of my ability. However I am currently unsure how to go from a (successfully created) dataNFT with datatokens to a DID. I looked in the documentation for an answer but have so far failed to find the link between going from ‚ÄúPublish with Fixed Pricing‚Äù to ‚ÄúUpdate Metadata‚Äù. I also tried running ‚Äúnpm test‚Äù within a cloned instance of the ocean.js repository which failed at step 6.2 create/set Metadata with a timeout (I think to know the issue is within network constraints on macOS (I am on a MacBook), yet I haven‚Äôt figured out where precisely to change the urls of the individual services) and am now at a loss as to what to try. Therefore I would be very grateful for any tips, information, help or knowledge I don‚Äôt yet possess that could aid in my attempt to have a proper asset with did and ddo.

Ideally you review the algorithms that are allowed on your dataset so that it doesn't just return it. This can work with static datasets and you can team up with someone that creates the algorithm so that both of you can profit. The best use case is with dynamic data (that updates constantly) so the user need to start a c2d job each week or each month depending on how fast the data updates.,,,0.9274

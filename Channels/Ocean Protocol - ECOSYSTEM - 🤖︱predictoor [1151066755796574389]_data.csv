The accuracy above 50% doesn't take into account two things: 1: trading fees, 2: if the trading bot itself will have an impact on the market that negatively is related to profitability.

Our base models are currently simple. Only using linear regression, and a single timeframe that you specify... such as 1h timeframe.

**[Overview of how slots/epochs work]**
In this case, we're trying to predict the price at t+1, our dataframe/xY will look like this (1 hour slots/epochs).
```
timestamp  price
00:00:00  1000
00:01:00  1005.?? < this is happening now, so the 1h candle hasn't closed yet
00:02:00  t+1 < what we're predicting for
```

This means that 5m, 15m, and 30m data is not included in the model building.
**This also means that we can't wait for 00:01:00 to close, because we need to submit the prediction for 00:02:00 before the candle closes.**

The best thing you could do here without a lot of work, is to submit predictions for t+1 right before the candle closes, using the current (00:01:00) price.

**predictoor_agent3.py is already implemented to do this.** => https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/1184520151912165496/1184895704196468888",,,0.7941

Actually my question is more: is the current price before the candle closes added to hist_df? I am not sure this is the case. I have just run the main.py file to inspect hist_df variable with a 5mn timeframe (to reach the end of the epoch faster). 

Here is the message for the end of the epoch: 
```Take_step() begin.
  block_number=3937933, prev=3937932
  Got new block. Timestamp=1702633144
    Process [Feed 0xda1e3 BTC/USDT|binance|5m] at epoch=5675443
      56 s left in epoch (predict if <= 60 s left)
      Predict for time slot = 1702633500...```
It's 9h39 and I want to predict 9h45. 

When I inspect hist_df, the last available timestamp  is `1702632900000` (9h35)
which means that the data_factory.py doesn't fetch the current value at 9h39 unless I am wrong? But maybe this is what you meant and that you suggested to modify the data_factory.py file to add the current price right before the candle closes. Can you confirm please? Thx upfront for the clarification 🙏
EDIT: I assumed the last timestamp in hist_df corresponded to the closing time of the candle. But this is wrong... This is why I got confused 🙂 The close column of the last row gives me the current price then 👍",,,0.4514

I think you're right that the current price is not included in hist_df because the candle hasn't closed yet, so it will not be included.

If you wanted to inject more granular candle data, (but this adds a lot of records, and increases the number of dimensions of your model making it more costly to train/etc...) is to create a dataframe that is composed of 1m + 5m data... whether this improves the performance of the model significantly or not... well, that's part of the exploratory work.

To exemplify this, here is a pseudo df where your implementation would consist of 11 columns:
- 1 for timestamp
- 5 for ohlcv 1m
- 5 for ohlcv 5m

this way, you can a more complete representation of price in a dataframe
```
ts | ohlcv_1m_btc_binance | ohlcv_5m_btc_binance
1 | 1000 | 1000
2 | 1001 | 1000
3 | 1002 | 1000
4 | 1001 | 1000
5 | 1001 | 1000 << 5m candle closes here
6 | 1002 | 1001 << 5m columns would then start using the last 5m ohlcv candle, while 1m columns continue using historical 1m ohlcv candles
```

You are now in the realm of improving model performance, and there are 100 things you can work towards to improving it. Rather than us guessing, there is a lot of literature on the subject. One of the best resources on it today is the book: ""Advances in Financial Machine Learning 1st Edition by Marcos Lopez de Prado"". I also recommend searching the web as there are many resources and libraries that build upon it.

LMK if you have more questions.",,🙏 (1),0.9621

Are there other ways to lose OCEAN besides losing predictions? Because I have been thinking and figuring out but i should be in profit even though my balance is only decreasing
```

Not quite... but it's important to understand the details... (as laid out in the docs/blogpost linked  by AwesomeQA)

If you predict with 0.5 OCEAN, while others are predicting with 0.1 OCEAN, if you lose, you lose your whole stake... not 0.1.
So, it's important to get a measure for how others are staking such that you're taking the right amount of risk.

We're working towards building more tooling around this such that it's easier for predictoors to monitor and improve their stake. TBD.",,,0.5267

The close column of the last row in hist_df corresponds to the current. I realized it after calling ccxt api multiple times in a row: the close and volume columns got updated everytime with the live data. 

As the rest of your post, I don't necessarily want to inject more granular data at this point. Instead, I want to make sure I get the best approximation of the coin price at t. I have already trained a deep learning model that I would like to leverage on this project.

I also have two additional questions in the implementation process: 
- at the moment, the base_predictoor_agent.py run several predictions within the last 60 sec. I slightly modified  the prediction_agent3.py to load my trained model from the cloud instead of doing a full training. This goes much faster. The downside is it triggers the predictions several times... Correct me if I am wrong but I guess I should adjust the base_predictoor_agent.py to avoid this scenario as I don't want to stake several times.
- It looks like my predictions are not properly saved on my wallet (`total_predictions`  is always 0 when executing the get_predictoor_info.py file). My arguments seem correct though. Do you have any clue on how to troubleshooti it?

2. The model/system we're building is designed to re-train/build/predict on the fly. Please be mindful of this as training/deploying something on the cloud (or even locally) will change the behavior we're designing for.

This will evolve in the future... I.e. build/cache/re-use model for 10 epochs.

As you probably know, trained models can drift in performance, and managing ML models is a practice on its own.

3. The predictor agent has been designed to make multiple submissions in the last 60s.

Why?
- each prediction will have different data as p1 will have the latest_price up to the last 60s. Then p2 will be up to the last 30s. Finally p3 might have most of the last candle data, up-to-the very end of the epoch.

Look at pdr_trader for how to cache/check if you've already submitted a prediction for an epoch if you only want to submit once... Again, please be mindful of the example I gave above as to why we do this as the default behavior.

4. Make sure that your bot submitted something first, then run the script against the right network and that your start/end times look good.

If you are still having issues, try running this subgraph query in our sapphire subgraph directly to see if you can find any of the predictions you have submitted for in the past: https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/5c1a67796c680c610111cd238005f639d298d5f3/pdr_backend/util/subgraph_predictions.py#L23

2. yes, I am aware of what it involves. I have trained a deep learning model and training it can take some time (+ 60 sec). Thus, I prefer managing the retraining process separately from the prediction.

I am trying to deploy my bot on a cloud run service. I managed to start the predictoor agent and I can see the logs running properly. However, after a few minutes (there is a 240s timeout actually), the service crashes and I get the following: 
`Default STARTUP TCP probe failed 1 time consecutively for container ""pdr-backend-my-predictooratest-1"" on port 8080. The instance was not started.`

Is it something you have already encountered? I am not really familiar with probe's settings in cloud run...

**EDIT: ** Fixed. I was blocked by the constraint of having a http server with Cloud Run Services. Since Nov 23 and the release of Cloud Run Jobs, it seems it's now possible to run background worker without the need of  a http server. 

**Issue with running local image with M1: **
I was not able to run the image locally on my mac (M1) because I get the following error when installing sapphire.py and loading the wrapper
```File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sapphirepy/wrapper.py"", line 32, in <module>
raise Exception(f""Unsupported architecture: {architecture}"")

Isn't it weird as arm64 and aarch64 are the same thing? I am wondering if there is not a condition missing here in the wrapper file? 🤔

No, unfortunately 😢 . But tx for following up 😉 
I am still stuck with the deployment to Cloud Run and the start-up probe issue. I created an endpoint to satisfy the need to listen to a port (when called the endpoint triggers the main.py file). With this solution the start-up probe issue is solved but I don't manage to run the main.py file inside my endpoint. I don't get why because the solution works locally... I am not a devops guy but I don't know if cloud run is a suitable solution to deploy the docker image - not sure the cloud run service is designed for an endless background job.

Sorry for delay 

To use Ocean Predictoor, follow these steps:

1.Play with predictoor.ai: Visit predictoor.ai to build intuition: observe the free feed, perhaps buy a few feeds, and watch them change over time.

2.Run a predictoor bot: Follow the steps in the Predictoor README https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md . Start by running simulations with AI-powered predictions. Then run a predictoor bot on a remote testnet staking fake OCEAN. Finally, do it on the mainnet staking real OCEAN.

3.Optimize the bot: Improve the model prediction accuracy with more data and better algorithms. Extend to predict more than one prediction feed. Wash, rinse, repeat.

Here is the intro to predictoor.

I have done something similar before with sklearn, trained a model with multiple Binance data (fetch them with their websocket, recorded in my db) and trained a model with it that has around 70% of accuracy but it predicts weekly price action.

Here's what you need to know:

 Challenges and Limitations:

Security: Using multiple bots with the same wallet increases your attack surface, as each bot needs access to private keys and could potentially drain funds. This is the biggest concern.
API Key Restrictions: Depending on the platform you use to connect your bots, API key limitations might hinder running multiple bots simultaneously.
Exchange Restrictions: Some cryptocurrency exchanges impose limitations on the number of bots or API keys allowed per account.
Complexity: Managing and coordinating multiple bots with different strategies can be challenging and susceptible to unintended consequences.
 Potential Workarounds:

Multiple Wallets: This is the safest option, requiring separate wallets for each bot with unique private keys. However, managing multiple wallets effectively adds complexity and requires strong security practices.
Single Bot with Strategy Switching: Develop a single bot capable of switching between different prediction strategies based on defined parameters. This offers flexibility while maintaining control in one place.
Testnets and Simulations: Utilize platforms like Ocean Testnet or other simulations to test your bots and strategies without risking real funds. This is recommended before deploying bots on the mainnet.
Cloud Providers and Virtual Machines: Explore advanced setups using cloud providers like AWS or Azure to create isolated virtual machines for each bot, potentially improving security but requiring technical expertise.
 Disclaimer:

Due to the inherent security risks, running multiple bots on the same wallet is generally not recommended.
Carefully consider the risks and legal implications in your region before using bots for trading.
Thoroughly research and understand the limitations and complexity involved before attempting any workaround.
Never share your private keys or seed phrases with any bot or program.",,❤️ (1),0.9895

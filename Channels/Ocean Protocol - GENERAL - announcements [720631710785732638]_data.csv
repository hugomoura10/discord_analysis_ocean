“This will help us to extend Ocean tech into the financial services sector by helping to maintain compliance w/ global regulations & standards, while providing traditional institutional finance & fintech entities an entry point to DeFi.” Ocean COO Razvan Olteanu

""This partnership allows financial institutions and DeFi platforms to use the Ocean Protocol data layer and data marketplace to build innovative products in line with global regulations such as Europe’s PSD2 and GDPR.” AllianceBlock Founder & CEO Rachid Ajaja

Press release:
<https://t.co/B8hjzkR8jS>

Grants are up to $50K worth of OCEAN, with funding rounds following a monthly cadence. 

Teams that keep delivering may get grants every month. 
New teams get a special earmark, so they don’t have to compete against existing teams.

“We live in a digital economy, a data economy. But it’s closed. This generous funding is how we kickstart an open Web3 data economy, to democratize access to data and its benefits.” - @trentmc0, co-founder of Ocean Protocol <https://t.co/EGARXkMxzP>

The formula that stands behind the $140 million USD sum for grants is: 1.41B OCEAN * 51% * ¼ , where 1.41B is the total OCEAN supply, 51% is the percentage of the overall OCEAN token supply dedicated to Network Rewards.

""Data - when openly, transparently exploited, can be extremely powerful and valuable.""

Ocean founder @BrucePon discussed how the confluence of #blockchain, #AI, and #data can kickstart the New Data Economy at the #GitexGlobal conference at @Dubai today 🌊 
Highlights below!

Today, the world’s leading companies are data-centric, and currently, up to 90% of a company’s value relies on its data and IP. The key to unlocking this is blockchain technology which allows for secure provenance of data. However, there are barriers to its monetization.

Right now, there is a disconnect between data consumers and providers of data. With the lack of incentive to share, a valuable resource for our knowledge economy is under-utilized. Ocean’s works to allow for the sharing and monetization of data in a privacy-preserving fashion.

(1) Nurturing the growing community of our monthly grants program is a core pillar. Thus, as of Round 11 we are introducing OceanDAO Stewards, who will meet with grantees before the proposal deadline, to provide guidance towards ROI > 1. Stewards will also be in charge with vetting teams to be eligible for higher-level rewards. A >50% vote by all stewards in multisig is needed to access the higher funds.

(2) Quadratic Voting remains a key deliverable for @OceanDAO_, however we will continue working and improving it, to avoid the following:
 
- Sybil attack
- An orchestrated attack
- Become a central authority in grant-voting outcomes
- Fracture voter & grantee participation

Let's take a dive into what they aim to accomplish 👇

VORN envisions integrating the Ocean wallet into their app and enable the trading of VORN member bio-metric and spatial data on the Ocean marketplace while also utilizing Ocean's compute-to-data offering for third party research.

Problems to solve: 

🚩 Promoting user-exclusive data control rights 
🚩 Lack of marketplaces where data has value and can be securely exchanged

Grant deliverables: 

✅ Bio-metric data measurement
✅ Data cleaning and analysis
✅ Data set collection for professional and semi-professional athletes
✅ Ocean Wallet integration into VORN App

Access details here: https://t.co/XarUBFaelQ

As the name suggests, Disrupt MLS aims to disrupt the centralization of homebuyer inventory data on the MLS. The project will seek to gain traction in markets where there is no centralized MLS.

Problems to solve:

🚩 Cut out the realtors, traditional MLS, and associated fees to enable unrestricted access to data 
🚩Ensuring property listing visibility that entering the MLS system provides

Grant deliverables: 

✅ Initiate the building of the landing page
✅ Develop of database that will store data
✅ api fetch data from landing page to store on database

The research highlights how Ocean enables the monetization of private data while preserving privacy. @PalmerBTIG

Check out the full report: https://bit.ly/31s7mpT

Leveraging blockchain technology to put users in control of their data, the report branded Ocean as a strong ""alternative to data monopolies"". 

Main highlights: 

✅ The protocol, by creating tools for manipulating data infrastructures, unlocks “data legos.”

✅ Through OCEAN tokens, users are incentivized to make valuable data available, while maintaining its confidentiality. 

✅ Ocean Market–a decentralized exchange (DEX) tuned for data, allows for dynamic pricing of data sets with a Balancer-powered automated market maker (AMM).

✅ The growth and long-term sustainability of Ocean is ensured by @OceanDAO_ providing community-curated grants.

✅ Ocean Protocol’s V4 is coming soon and will include several improvements for rug pulls and tokenizing copyrights on data

Dive into all the specifics of Ocean by reading the full report and keep an eye on this space for our 2022 announcements coming soon!

Ocean Shipyard is a complementary funding layer to @OceanDAO_, which is a bottom-up, community-curated grants program. Ocean Shipyard has a top-down approach - the OPF selects the proposals and requires delivery according to specific milestones.
Grant payments are contingent on the successful delivery of project milestones within a stipulated time frame and will be made in OCEAN tokens.
Launched in 2020, the 1st edition of Shipyard received  60+ applications from projects keen to build on Ocean Protocol. Previous Shipyard grant recipients include @DataunionA, @swashapp, @TransportGenie & many more, each team exploring different approaches to data monetization.

More details on the grants program are available here:

Data Farming. Ocean ecosystem. What are H2O plans to remove OCEAN token’s volatility from transactions?

The latest blogpost by @H2O_data dives into how data as an asset class is going to be effectively monetized with Data Farming! ⚒️

Let's unlock 🔐

✅ Yield farming has been a driving narrative in DeFi and is a method that allows crypto users to earn more cryptocurrency and provides protocols with added liquidity to fuel protocol growth.

✅ Unlike yield farming, Ocean's Data Farming has actual utility for all stakeholders. The liquidity providers earn additional tokens, the protocol receives sustainable liquidity, and the users can trust the protocol's secured data assets.

✅ The Ocean Data Farmers are responsible for sourcing liquidity to the OCEAN datatoken pools; and, in turn,  receive rewards in the form of OCEAN tokens. The data farmers can further multiply these rewards by using their stake datasets.

✅ Transacting with Ocean Protocol's datasets requires using the OCEAN token and the H2O stable asset acts as a medium of exchange and unit of account and can be used for transacting with datatokens in the Ocean protocol - without token volatility.",,,0.9781

36 datasets have been highlighted to meet the minimum threshold of $OCEAN reserve, see the full list here:
🌊For pools with less than 500 $OCEAN in reserve, the gas fees for a data pool migration exceed the amount of $OCEAN locked. Thus, no action is required and datatoken holders will be compensated for the amount they staked directly.

Any LP that does not lock their pool shares by the deadline, will still be able to withdraw their stake but will NOT receive the 10% bonus.

OceanONDA V4 solves rug pulls in the datatoken pools, introduces data NFTs, expands the options for the community to monetize, and delivers updates to Ocean Market. 

💡Read more about the new features and the 18 month-journey to get here:
https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceanonda-v4-production-has-arrived-cb4fe8faaf39

All the key components of OceanONDA V4 are deployed to production chains on Ethereum mainnet and Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Energy Web, and Moonriver.

1/ It is safer to stake liquidity in datatoken pools by solving rug pulls, through one-sided staking.✅

2/ A centrepiece of the OceanONDA V4 release is the introduction of ERC721 data NFTs. A data NFT represents the copyright (or exclusive license against copyright) for a data asset on the blockchain — the “base IP” (intellectual property).✅

3/ OceanONDA V4 has improved community monetization for selling data, running a marketplace or providing liquidity and it added a fourth one - by running your own Provider. This means more revenue upside and more flexibility in how fees can be charged.✅

💡Ocean Market V4 is live in production with updates like a new publish flow and a data NFT image generator:

https://market.oceanprotocol.com

💡Ocean docs are live in production, explore them here:

Data Providers: Publishing a dataset takes no more than 3 minutes. 

Just follow these simple steps 👇

1. Head over to the publish form here: https://market.oceanprotocol.com/publish/1 and enter the metadata 📝 of your Ocean Data NFT  

Note: You can publish your Data NFT on different chains. Namely #Ethereum #polygon #BSC #EWC #MoonRiver 💥

2. Select the #data access type ⚒

""Download"" is for non-sensitive information. It allows data buyers to download your dataset

""Compute-to-Data"" is for sharing sensitive data. Data is not downloadable, and the buyer can run compute jobs on it without accessing confidential data

3. Set the price 💰 

""Fixed"" prices the datatoken at the entered amount of OCEAN

""Dynamic"" creates an automated market for your dataset. This means the price is determined by the ratio of OCEAN to datatoken

""Free"" gives the datatoken for free via creating a faucet

4. Review & Publish ✅ 

This will create the tokens & pricing, construct & encrypt DDO via Ocean providers, and eventually publish the encrypted DDO on-chain as part of the Data NFT

At the end of last week, we noticed suspicious behaviour in several Ocean Market data pools that resulted in a loss of some OCEAN.

Here is an overview of what happened since, why it happened and the mitigation measures that are being taken to prevent further attack vectors.

Let's unpack👇 

https://t.co/qqIv32svbe

🚨 The first series of attacks took place last Thu around 7pm CEST time. Attacker executed the following actions in loop:

Stake OCEAN in a data pool
Buy datatokens
Unstake OCEAN
Sell datatokens

Through this sequence, small amounts of OCEAN were drained from data pools.

After reports from the Ocean community, we implemented the following change as short-term mitigation:

✅Raised the swap fee to 15% to make the attacks unprofitable

✅We also explored solutions in how to mitigate the risks long term

🚨 On Monday, July 11, the attacker re-started their attempts to drain Ocean data pools, this time using over $600,000 OCEAN.

Following feedback from the community and recent learnings, we are introducing veOCEAN to best align the incentives of token holders and liquidity providers.  

Continue reading 👇 <https://t.co/Cme16cby0x>

How?🌟 

veOCEAN holders can lock their $OCEAN tokens over a time period to earn rewards and voting power. The longer the lock period, the higher the rewards and the voting power.

They can also vote on proposals and earn rewards, both from consume fees and data farming.

veOCEAN holders can earn passive rewards, solely by locking their $OCEAN. 

Or, they can be active by allocating veOCEAN to higher-quality datasets for greater earnings.

Going forward, veOCEAN will be the main mechanism for staking $OCEAN and for curation of datasets. It’s lower risk than Ocean datatoken pools, and it delivers similar benefits.

Athena will add value to the ecosystem by developing an interface to accredit data prior to publishing and introducing easy-to-consume climate datasets🌊

Let's unpack!👇

✅Athena's mission is to build IoT and computing solutions for bridging the gap between the offline world and the blockchain world to ensure transparency, equity and algorithmic accountability in automated data collection and verification processes.

https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-shipyard-announces-its-first-2022-grantee-athena-protocol-50fdfdccbf2d

✅To facilitate ethical collection of data on a global scale, Athena leverages SolarPunk Network (SPN)

✅This enables real-time monitoring without sacrificing privacy whilst bridging the gap between stakeholders and the decision-making processes

How will it impact the Ocean ecosystem?🤔

🌊By Sept 2022, Athena will develop an interface for proposing data assets and managing asset portfolios. This will allow the team to focus on processes and procedures for Social Credentials & data NFTs.

🌊The first ESG asset verification suite v1 will be accredited and published soon after, allowing for multi-token contracts for algorithmic consensus.

🌊2 pilots with full-scale ESG MRV project proponents to quantify ecosystem services will also be launched.

$85,000 USD in OCEAN are available for Web3 data economy projects that will build on Ocean and contribute to its growing ecosystem!🌊

DDL - Aug 2 @ midnight UTC

Round 20 will be geared towards 👇
 
✅Biasing to those who engage for the love of doing it. An engaged, diverse community.

✅Rewards flow to contributors (with OCEAN) who are effective at delivering results. 

✅More efficient capital spending, yet lighter tracking overhead

Approaches to improving OceanDAO⚒️

🌊Starting with R21, the main pillar will be retroactive grants only for outcomes already achieved.

🌊OceanDAO will give more space to earlier-stage projects compared to experienced ones, by capping the total funding amount for a project.

Round 20 Changes 👀

💡Total funding of 75,000 USD (min.)

💡100,000 USD max. per project in a lifetime

💡100,000 USD max. per team in a lifetime (not including Advisors)

Funding ceiling per tier

💡New projects - 3K USD 

💡Existing projects -  7.5K USD (have completed one grant from OceanDAO)

💡Experienced projects - 15K USD (have completed two or more grants)

In the next Round 21, we will also introduce the following 👇

🚀Retroactive Grants - Projects will apply for grants that fund the outcome of work they did, not plan to do

🚀2 Months Cycle per Round - Total funding of 150,000 USD available

🚀New funding ceilings per tier

You are encouraged to submit proposals early via the Proposal Portal. Note that proposals can no longer be submitted through Ocean Port directly.

Acentrik’s collaboration with Ocean Protocol began in 2020, with a proof of concept exploring decentralized data orchestration for Mercedes-Benz. The pilot project was successful and this led to further collaboration and development of Acentrik Version 1.0. As part of the collaboration with Ocean Protocol, Acentrik Version 1.0 has leveraged and integrated specific Ocean features, with key adaptations made for enterprise users.

Acentrik is a fork of Ocean Market and makes use of the OceanONDA V4 smart contracts and libraries. Built on the foundation of Ocean technology, Acentrik’s mission is to make it easier for enterprises to unlock the value of decentralized data and enable data sharing with the principle of data sovereignty at the core. With Acentrik’s V1.0, enterprises can now publish datasets with parameters.

We're thrilled to announce that the integration with @H2O_data is completed, and $H2O is now available in Ocean Market. 

$H2O will enable data buyers and sellers to benefit from more price stability.

How? Let's take a quick look 👀

What is H2O and why is it important? 💧 

✅$H2O is an $OCEAN backed, non-pegged stable asset, aiming to be the de facto medium of exchange within the entire Web3 Data ecosystem and based on the RAI stable asset by @reflexerfinance.

✅$H2O is decentralized, permissionless, minimizes governance and typically settles at ~$1.60

Since data can now be priced in $H2O, and $H2O fluctuates far less than $OCEAN, users can benefit from very little exposure to volatility in Ocean Market. This will bring two near-term benefits:

1️⃣  First, data sellers get more predictable revenue as revenue is no longer dependent on $OCEAN price.
2️⃣ Second, data buyers have more predictable costs as costs are no longer dependent on $OCEAN price.

❔How do I get $H2O tokens?
Locking OCEAN to mint $H2O via the H2O dapp here: https://app.h2odata.xyz  
Buy $H2O in an exchange such as the Uniswap: https://buff.ly/3ysO2p5>

Know What is❓H2O and why is it important by @oceanprotocol 

💠$H2O is an $OCEAN backed, non-pegged stable asset, aiming to be the de facto medium of exchange within the entire Web3 Data ecosystem and based on the RAI stable asset by @reflexerfinance

💠$H2O is decentralized, permissionless, minimizes governance & typically settles at ~$1.60

💠Data can now be priced in $H2O & $H2O fluctuates far less than $OCEAN, users can benefit from very little exposure to volatility in Ocean Market✅

The project focuses on a versatile open source data aggregation system for the Ocean Protocol Community🌊
Let's take a deeper look 👀

✅Driven by the mission to create a database with verified properties for the proptech industry, Directimo aims to deliver the foundation to scrape most of the websites around the globe by developing a tool to extract data from various sites for further processing.

What are the benefits? 🤔

🛠The solution will minimize the programming knowledge that developers need to have to extract data from multiple sites in parallel. The data so collected will provide access to powerful insights from the market.

🌊Directimo will employ advanced technologies including Python, Redis and Kafka to create a distributed on-demand scraping cluster. The goal is to leverage this to further facilitate a real-estate model that’s scalable on a global level 👀

💬 @sjohns, Ecosystem & Partnerships, Ocean Protocol said:
""We are particularly excited because Directimo tools will be available to the entire Ocean community and will dramatically help onboard quality data onto Ocean.""

💬#AlexandruDan, CTO of Directimo, further commented:
""Web scrapers automatically collect information and data that's usually only accessible by visiting a website. By doing this autonomously, web scraping scripts open up a world of possibilities in data mining and analysis""

Get ready, Oceaners! 🛠️

👀veOCEAN goes live next Monday (Sep 26). Data Farming will resume three days later (Thursday)!🌊

Let's dive into the details!👇

⁉️What is veOCEAN? 
 It is the main mechanism for locking $OCEAN and for curating datasets on Ocean - it’s lower risk than datatoken pools, and delivers more benefits.

What can I do with veOCEAN?👇
✅ Lock $OCEAN to receive veOCEAN, and earn passive rewards. 

✅ Use veOCEAN to curate data with high Data Consume Volume (DCV) and get even more rewards.

✅ Vote on @OceanDAO_ proposals

Here is an overview of the timeline⏰

📅Sep 26: veOCEAN goes live. Lock your OCEAN for veOCEAN at http://df.oceandao.org

📅Sep 29: Counting for Data Farming /DF5 resumes

📅Oct 6: DF5 payouts resume. Counting starts for DF6

📅Oct 13: DF6 payout; DF7 counting starts

Please note ⚠️

DF will follow phases as before. When it resumes, it will be with a new “VE/DF Alpha” phase for 4 weeks. “DF Beta” and “DF Main” phases will follow, as previously targeted.

💰Grant: 65,000 USD (paid in OCEAN) 

⏰DDL: October 10 @ midnight UTC

Here's all you need to know about this round: 

✅OceanDAO will be shifting more community budget to veOCEAN & Data Farming (more automated, yet aligned objectives), and away from grants (higher governance touch)

✅Retroactive grants will not be implemented at this point

This is what the funding will look like for this round: 

🌊55,000 USD allocated for the regular grants program

🌊10,000 USD will be allocated for Algovera AI micro-grants

💰New projects - 3K USD (New project: never previously received a grant from OceanDAO)

💰Existing projects - 6K USD (Existing project: have completed one grant from OceanDAO)

💰Experienced projects - 12K USD (Experienced project: have completed two or more grants)

Important note ⚠️

To submit proposals, participants must use the Proposal Portal here: https://seed.oceandao.org

Proposals will then be published on Ocean Port. All proposals that meet the essential criteria are then submitted to Snapshot.

💥As part of the collaboration:

✅Ocean will link its data marketplace with peaq’s economy of machine-generated goods and services to deliver a  data monetization toolkit for builders creating decentralized applications on the peaq network.

✅ Ocean's Compute-to-Data and data-pricing mechanisms will also be leveraged to power system architecture for a seamless exchange of information between providers and customers of mobility applications.

✅Future integrations will be designed to ensure that all machines running on peaq are able to seamlessly link with Ocean’s data marketplace and trade a vast array of data types in a secure peer-to-peer manner.

Hi everyone,

The new version of the Data Farming portal is out.
1. You will now be able to find the Passive, Active, and Global APY being reported in the Rewards page.
2. You will now be able to see the Average APY for Passive, Active, and Globally, when you are disconnected from the app.
3. You will now be able to see Your APY for Passive, Active, and Globally, when you are connected to the app and the needed requirements.
4. You should now be able to compare Your APY to the Global APY across each Reward Category, and get a better idea of how you are performing.

You can find the update here.
https://df.oceandao.org/

*Note #1: Active Rewards reports a variable APY that is constantly changing and starts at 0.0% at the beginning of every DF Round.
Note #2: Your APY and the Average APY can hit 0.00% when the Data Farming round resets, or if you're recently allocated. Farming is active and takes time to yield rewards.*

🌊 Oceaners, we’re writing this message as a result of the unfortunate incident that happened on our Discord server recently. This morning we noticed that someone managed to gain control of the server by exploiting a vulnerability in the captcha system. As a result, they created a fake airdrop, and although our team was fast in catching this, it's possible that some of you may have accessed the link and experienced losses.

First, we want to say that we are sorry for any inconvenience and potential loss that this incident may have caused you. We understand it might have raised some concern and frustration within our community. And we take this very seriously, actively discussing internally, to find how we can best support those affected.

We want to assure you that our core team members are always taking numerous security measures, including two-factor authentication (2FA) and strong passwords for the accounts. Unfortunately, determined hackers can still find ways to exploit vulnerabilities, even with such precautions in place.

We want to emphasize that no OCEAN tokens were drained during this incident, and there were no casualties apart from the potential loss resulting from accessing the fraudulent link. However, we understand the impact this event can have on individuals within our community, and we are committed to learning from this experience to improve the security and resilience of our platform moving forward.
Moving forward, if you have been affected by this incident, please fill in this form: https://forms.gle/FbcG8gRVugZyq59s7.

We genuinely care about our community and will do everything we can to provide the necessary support and guidance during this time.

In light of recent events, we kindly remind our valued community members to exercise caution and diligence when it comes to airdrops or clicking on links. Take extra precautions, verify the authenticity of sources, and ensure official authorization. Your safety is paramount. If you're uncertain about any activity or encounter, please reach out to us. Together, we'll continue fostering a secure and resilient ecosystem. Your trust and support mean the world to us, and we're putting in our effort to prevent any similar incidents from happening in the future.

Thank you all for your understanding and being part of our incredible community and remember to stay vigilant! 🙌",,"❤️ (42),🫂 (14),ocean (12),🌊 (6)",0.9686

**Subject**: New Twitter Bounty Rewards for all Ocean Protocol Ambassadors 🌊

GM Sailors, we are thrilled to introduce a revamped bounty program, with new rewards for your Twitter campaigns 🐦

Starting this Sunday 15th October, we will introduce a 2-tiered reward system for Twitter bounties with both: 🔹Base Rewards & 🔸Bonus Rewards

**🔹 Base Reward**
Every week, the **Top 3** threads with the highest number of impressions 📈 will receive a $100 Base Reward 💵 To be eligible for this reward, a minimum of 250 impressions on your thread is required 📊

**🔸 Bonus Reward**
In addition to the Base Reward, we are introducing a $100 Bonus Reward 🌟 which will be given every week to the best thread of the week 🏆 as voted by the Ocean Protocol community 👥

📋 How It Works

1️⃣Write up a twitter thread 🧵 about Ocean Protocol tagging @oceanprotocol or $OCEAN. Each week there's a different topic so make sure to check the ""Topic of the Week"" first
2️⃣Apply, and paste the link of your Twitter thread here: https://x.postmint.xyz/community/6526b1df4300e98ead0166d9/6527aa954300e98ead016e44
3️⃣Base Rewards will be automatically paid out at the end of each week (yayyyy, faster payments🎉) and Bonus Rewards will be manually distributed each week after the community voting 🗳️ 

By incorporating both Base and Bonus Rewards, we aim to increase reach & awareness around the New Data Economy 🌐

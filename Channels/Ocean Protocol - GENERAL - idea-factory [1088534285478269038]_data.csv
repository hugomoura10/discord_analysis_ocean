I totally get where you're coming from! It's pretty surprising when a Web 3 company still sticks with a Web 2 one. I mean, Web 3 is all about decentralization and moving away from the big players like FAGAM. Instead, it's about embracing decentralized cloud infrastructure. So, using Google forms kind of contradicts the whole Web 3 vision, you know? And in Europe, people are really taking their digital sovereignty seriously. They're even taking legal action against FAGAM.
I've got a couple of suggestions for you to consider. How about using a form that stores information as an NFT linked to an Ocean DID? That way, it aligns more with decentralization and it's a great use case for Ocean. Plus, let's keep it simple! Maybe limit it to just three clicks from one wallet. That would make it super user-friendly and efficient.",,,0.958

An NFT form is quite an innovative idea indeed. As we carefully allocate our resources to best drive our organization's goals forward, developing an NFT form isn't quite high on our organizational priorities. That said, we do occasionally use Web 2 tools that drive our efficiency so that we don't have to reinvent the wheel in certain areas - hence using Discord for communications and Google for forms. Creative feedback is always welcome 🙂 Feel free to keep the ideas coming!",,,0.9763

The transition from Web 2 to Web 3 is inevitable, and it brings exciting possibilities. I envision – for the moment - Ocean Protocol as a storage middleware between DApps and data assets, handling authentication and authorization. In a way, it can be seen as a Web 3 database where NFTs are stored as records.
What's intriguing about Web 3 architecture is that it can be seen as a massive decentralized computer. It enables extensive computation in a decentralized manner, which is a stark contrast to traditional data centers. These centralized compute nodes (aka data center), aside from being unsustainable and straining national power grids, pose security concerns due to centralization.
Consider climate research, where datasets spanning 10 years and captured from smart IoT devices are used. Web 3 architecture, with its incentive mechanisms for citizens and companies to share computing and storage resources, could provide an economically viable solution. Adding Ocean Protocol's smart control ensures efficient data management, outsourcing tasks like lifecycle management and data copy management, thus limiting the impact of outages with the option to create a digital commons. (eg climate data as a digital common asset )
The potential of Web 3 extends beyond climate research, empowering users with control over their data and digital assets. By embracing blockchain technology, decentralized applications, and protocols, we can create a more secure, private, and user-centric internet. The transition to Web 3 is an exciting step towards a decentralized future! 💻🌐🚀",,"💯 (3),❤️ (2)",0.9912

So if you go back in history to the famous orange farm where the Howey test was invented - a farmer sells rights to the future oranges that will be grown on a piece of land, thus creating a security as:
1. Financial investment - you spend money to acquire your share ✅
2. Shared enterprise - an NFT/IP NFT gets fractionalised and everyone gets a share ✅
3. Expectation of profits solely from the efforts of others - you are not going to do the research in the case of an IPT, in the case of fractionalising a DataNFT you are also a passive holder of your fraction while others contribute or sell the data. ✅

It could of course be argued in 3. that you somehow are doing something but I am not a lawyer, for me its clear that your share of the work is not going to bring most of the money, that is why you work with others.

Thus you create a security.

In the end a protocol like Molecule or other NFT fractionalising protocols don't have to care too much about this, as the users of the tech are the ones breaking the law, not the protocols themselves.
But the users of the tech like VitaDAO or someone then creating a fractionalised NFT will be legally responsible.

I am not a lawyer, I just follow the crypto space for 6 years now and it is a common theme that people create tech that will put their users in jail in their jurisdiction when they use it, IF the government would care enough. So I always recommend caution or to move somewhere where these things don't matter too much.",,"👍 (1),🙏 (1)",0.9724

@Sarah (Sweet Chilli) Makes perfect sense. These are fantastic builds and ideas! @Robin | DataUnion mentioned something in that direction, but nothing is set yet (AFAIK).

@LRT  I will see if there’s (free) platforms unlike Meetup.com where I can get people together. Meetup is my go-to for all networking but there’s probably free sites. Most meetings are virtual anyway. 

If I make a group and it gets big, maybe then it would make sense to invest in meetup to reach out even further, but you’re right that it’s best to start small before doing the monthly payment. Thanks for the advice 🙂",,,0.9632

NEAR has a similar sort of ambassador program, except it's called a ""guild"" system. Guilds can be literally anything from Technical Analysis guilds or Solidity Developers, anything and everything crypto related. So my initial thought was that since theres this guild system that can produce such specialized and ""peer reviewed""  data, which would easily be monetizable on the OCEAN marketplace. So I'm sure there's already some guilds who intend to do exactly this,  so I thought maybe creating some sort of incentive program/strategic partnership might be worthwhile,  which would only grow both ecosystems positively.",,,0.9706

I saw your previous video and from what I understand the platform you are using to create them is providing you with images/objects and effects to create the video, right?

What is Ocean?
This is covered well by the Mission statement of Ocean here:
https://oceanprotocol.com/about

From my point of view the core components of Ocean Protocol have been created in the past - namely: marketplaces, compute-to-data and datatokens as well as the beginning of the OceanDAO. This can all be used to enhance Data Science.
That are the achievements.

What is still outstanding from the technical point of view is the integration of compute-to-data into the marketplace itself.
The only thing that is publicly know about it can be found in the roadmap of Ocean: https://oceanprotocol.com/roadmap
Quote:

In Ocean Market: buy & sell private data while preserving privacy
Mitigates risk of buyer-supplied malicious algorithms, via whitelisted algorithms or workflow for publisher to vet algorithms

To me this means that data can be sold without having to leave the storage of the data provider. Also that this data cannot be copied by the buyer.
But that the compute done by the algorithms are also covered by the data provider via their hardware. And that the data buyer will pay for this compute.",,,0.8108

I’m excited to join and discover how I can best use my skillset to help build on Ocean’s vision. I work in Product Development/Management and recently negotiated and implemented a $6.5m USD development contract with over 40 developers and designers. 

I’m eager to build products and am open to submitting a proposal for review but don’t yet have a strong use case. I’ve been speaking with @Mark about the positioning/business strategy with Ocean and keen to explore this topic in more detail. We collaborated on a question for the community below:",,,0.9403

As we understand, the Ocean protocol is ultimately a 2 sided marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of data. One could have a popular dataset on an Ocean Market which generates $500,000 in revenue and another person may have 500 datasets on Ocean Market generating $0 in revenue based on the demand for their data assets. 

It’s possible (but unlikely) that I am going to receive a lot of money for sharing my personal location data. Even in the best case scenario I may generate a few $100 dollars which some may find attractive but most will encounter too much friction/hesitation towards opening up and sharing their personal data for some relatively small sum of money. (This may not be the case in all situations/countries as a few hundred dollars will be a lot of money but in those cases the buying power of that consumer base would be lower and therefore the incentive for businesses to leverage that data would be lower also).",,👍 (1),0.9144

    1.    Benefit from being used in machine learning algorithms, AI etc to create value (i.e. there is demand for the data). 
    2.    Be sold to the market without the company receiving a significant backlash from existing customers/business partners/shareholders i.e. the benefits of enabling access to the data (revenues generated) outweigh the costs of providing secure access to the data for the market to consume. One could imagine a backlash against a local retailer if customers discovered that all of a sudden their shopping data was being sold by the retailer for profit.
This is where we start to get a little stuck… If there is huge revenue potential sitting behind closed doors (in privately held databases), then why wouldn’t a more traditional private company have come along and given the owners of these datasets the ability to compute against the datasets privately? Is this the secret sauce that’s only enabled through Ocean Protocol?

If not, then is it the open, networked and decentralised nature of the Ocean Protocol? Under this assumption we are assuming that an open, networked and decentralised org structure is the superior org structure for executing on this opportunity. 

It would be great to better understand this topic so that we can more accurately convey the USP to the market. Knowing the answer to this should also help indicate where to start looking for new business opportunities with Ocean.",,👍 (1),0.9911

This expands Ocean from being a two sided market to much more. The stakers become a part of the market as well. They curate, price and validate datasets but also benefit from that.

The combination of these features makes Ocean a 🦄.

Hi Scott! These are super valuable thoughts. Thanks for sharing!
The answer includes my personal perspective, there is potentially a lot more, but this is what is important in my opinion:

With compute-to-data you can sell data access without having the problems you mentioned. If set up correctly, there is no “backslash” from customers/business partners/shareholders because the data is never moved, data consumers never see the data itself.

Still, you (and any buyer) can generate insights on private data in a fully compliant way. This includes machine learning, business analytics, or other forms of data aggregation. It’s not about the data owner who can compute here. It’s about any potential buyer. And because Ocean is permissionless, this could be anyone.

As you say, this is a risk/reward trade-off. And the more sensitive the data, the more security you need to balance the risk. 

Data monetization makes sense for traditional companies in many cases, even when companies compete. MOBI is an example where traditional automakers can potentially share datasets for autonomous driving (without giving away the data) to compete with Tesla. In other cases, data can be a “byproduct” of a companies core business. In this case, it’s only a cost-center and they could start monetizing it. Compared to what is on the market right now, C2D is more about huge and valuable datasets. There are many similar examples we could think of.

“Turn your data storage into a profit center” (while keeping ownership and full control and being compliant) is one of the opportunities here.",,"✅ (2),👍 (2),🔥 (2)",0.9846

The pricing mechanism is definitely an interesting feature and one where the incentives that exist would probably be harder to replicate in a private model (in my head I keep comparing this to a private venture, not to discredit the Ocean project but to instead uncover the unique benefits of OP). Staking tokens on datasets encourages market participants to curate good data and send a signal to the market that ‘this is good data’ which is great. 

Open and permissionless access to data for C2D applications to run on is also another great benefit. Assuming this means that some people (with good intentions!) are accessing datasets they couldn’t otherwise access through other third party providers already. 

Data unions and shared data initiatives (like scanning bills and monetising as a group) is also a unique and interesting concept. In theory I could probably start something like that today (as a private venture) but be subject to a number of local laws and regulations (friction) and so doing something like this on OP where the incentives are closer to the consumer than they maybe are in a private model could be a unique benefit.",,,0.9966

In other words it can only spread its incentives so thinly before it runs out. 

OP (and other decentralised projects for that matter) are more organic and take on a life of their own. As they are open and permissionless, anyone can jump on board, have a go, at no cost to the overarching entity (OP) i.e, not many people are spending their spare time thinking up new ways for Jeff Bezos to grow his empire - he has to employ people to do that for him. 

Therefore, those that jump on board and build things the market wants are rewarded and those that don’t, simply try again or fade away. The equivalent would be trying to convince a bunch of investors to invest in a private company where we will pay anyone who walks in through the door to do stuff and some will succeed and others will fail but we don’t really know what’s going to happen. 😆

- Include the branding that @adan created
- Include the gallery of members that @Noé created
- Include our past achievements
- Include our future plans
- Include a calendar for events (thanks for the suggestion @sdntechforum )
- Offer links and information around the Ambassador program as well as to social media, how to become an Ambassador etc.

We hope you'll join us for the AMA with Matthias Kretschmann on Thursday 🙃 If you can, we'd love it if you could promote it within your own networks – esp. to solicit questions, which can be submitted on our Discord, Telegram, and Twitter by simply responding to the AMA announcement.

Matthias has been with ascribe, BigchainDB and Ocean for a long time, and knows Ocean Market inside out. Got a question about Ocean Market? How to get started with publishing datasets or algorithms? Curious about design for Web3 & dApps? Matthias has all of these covered.

Thank you!

Currently Director of Engineering at OLX Group (https://www.olxgroup.com/), technical background, but focused now on business/management areas - so I would like to contribute to the outreach ship (more about my experience here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/szymanskilukasz/)

I am also contributing to some blockchain-related projects as an advisor, and have strong network of blockchain-related creators, advocates, investors in Poland. 

I am fascinated by the Ocean Protocol, and I will try to contribute by building awareness/community in Poland and establishing some relationships/partnerships with companies.

2. Spoke on behalf of the Ambassador Program (which I didn’t).

Feels very rational and definitely something I’ll think about, as I do value the Ambassador program and all of you here!

Some thoughts.
- All future discussion in Data Whale videos will be circulating around market capitalization (not price).
- Video Caption & Thumbnail will still be heavily geared towards intensive clickbait, which may include references to price. However, price will not be explicitly discussed in the video itself, content is focused to be educational, though “sensational”.
- We’re not removing any past content.

1️⃣  Keep the policy as described in the pledge, no talk about the price of the Ocean token by Ambassadors, this is in line with the Ocean Protocol Foundation rule: Ambassadors ask themselves ""Would an OPF team member do this?"" before acting.
2️⃣  Change the policy to allow price talk and adapt the pledge accordingly. This allows Ambassadors to more actively promote the project in any way they see fit.

The poll will be open until Wednesday 8th of November 2021 at 4pm CEST, please only cast one vote.",,"1️⃣ (7),2️⃣ (3)",0.839

I'm basically a Clinical doctor who switched to building stuff products in MedTech ranging from Biomedical engineering to Clinical data-science & AI. So it's been a great revelation for me to learn about Ocean-protocol where AI meets Blockchain.

I wanna say I wish to be involved in both technical and outreach 😅 . I'm more of a Project manager kind of guy who is trained to be a code whisperer of sorts, so i can work with people who code, and i try my hand in scaling any initiative with the relevant outreach from a business perspective/engaging with people, speaking the language of amazing people who are involved in Technology products.

I have been interested in web3 since years and decided to sail a bit and find new things that can be done. In my opinion, data economy seems at its infancy and Ocean protocol is one of main web3 layers, enabling lots of data applications that is hard to imagine all of them from now. Thats why I decided to join the inn and build ships with this community.

As some of you may know I will have limited capacity to lead the Ocean Ambassador program over the next few weeks for personal reasons. During that time, the critical activities I was involved in will be covered by fellow senior Ambassadors. 

- @zippy1979 will take care of budget and finances. This process should move to Activity Farming and be managed as a team as early as February. In the meantime, Upkar will be in charge of validating with Ambassadors that they have completed their work, and preparing the list of payouts in OCEAN to Ambassadors.  

Upkar will also be the interim Program Lead, dealing with program improvements, being the liaison with the rest of the ecosystem, managing weekly updates in the OceanDAO meeting (this should be taken in turns by different ambassadors), and ensuring things run smoothly overall.

- @Andrea | Ocean Protocol will be the Community & Activity Lead, managing our group, the onboarding of new ambassadors and managing/coordinating the work of Ambassadors to ensure quality and timely deliveries.

- @Robin | DataUnion will prepare the Grant Proposal for OceanDAO R14, and keep co-approving transactions with me from our Gnosis safe.

Responsibilities and work in different WGs should be unaffected. I may have more time to allocate to the program than I anticipate, but I prefer to plan for the worst case and ensure that we have the right level of support for the group at all time.",,🤝 (4),0.7717

- Recruit new active members in OceanDAO (projects, voters, WG contributors), with local and targeted events
- Keep relaying partnership and other announcements from OPF, as well as support the creation of communication at a conceptual level (+ create specific artefacts based on the concepts developed to be used for outreach)
- There could be some budget for a campaign, e.g. video, specifically targeting ambassadors to grow the group and keep driving the visibility for the big announcements to come
- There will be a new WG set-up specifically for outreach, and we will join, together with the local programs. This is going to be where the latest news are shared, and wider coordination re communication will take place. It's exciting!

Besides, there are awesome things in the pipeline!

https://indian-ocean.gitbook.io/indian-ocean-outreach-program/

This essentially covers the roadmap and activities that we have set out to complete by end of this month.

Would be nice to have some feedback before I accelerate on a few promo activities. We have also placed a program in the name of 'Indian Ocean' ambassadors, who also have to complete the Ocean Academy. The aim is to have a lot of funneling outreach through the ambassadors from now on. We were glad to onboard @Gyan | Starknet Foundation/TPG as one of our first Ambassadors through both Academy as well as through the google form that we have mentioned in the Gitbook.

On a high-level, expecting some feedback on

- Overall information flow - is it sufficient? Giving a good intel of what's been played out so far?
- How the specific Ambassador program google form looks in line with Ocean 101 activities?
- We have not really decided on any promo-based activities yet for Indian ambassadors, but we will be sourcing it completely from the budget reserved for us during the R10 budget.

- Any other feedback that can help us?

**On a parallel note:** We are also working on a few workshop initiatives that will help folks convert better for the Ocean academy that is often regarded as 'too heavy' for complete beginners. We intend to follow the process, but would be happy to receive some feedback on all the above.

Ocean 101 was designed (I did not participate here) very carefully with the specific intent to bring people from 0 to a minimum understanding of OP. This to me is the base minimum one requires to work/integrate and keep up with the conversations and iterations of OPF. If one cannot readily grasp this, 101, I'm along the lines that they should keep working at it until it makes sense. I really cannot see this as 'too heavy' and think if people find it so, perhaps Ocean Protocol is not for them.  Are you trying to educate people or help them pass for certification, perhaps that is what I do not understand?",,,0.8221

While I'm on the same ethos that you had put forth. I'm merely echoing a few sentiments that I had received during my recent interactions with the community who expressed interest with both Ambassador group/ the Indian outreach which has a few subjective process as well but all are welcome to stay on our socials. They wanted better help in going through the academy with some handholding, which we are motivated to provide in our best capacity. 

While we wish to increase the ambassadors organically , some might take their own time before coming around to completing the academy. The aim of the Indian outreach is to also help the interested people to complete the academy as an Ambassador, not for passing it off as a certification from the Protocol.

Finally valid point taken from @LRT , will ensure that the the onboarding doesn't really clutter with @Andrea | Ocean Protocol 's process. We can have updates to any article that is being published about Ocean academy now/future in line with any changes made to the contents/website.",,,0.9924

Re recruitment, here is how i view things overall:
- if we are talking about ocean ambassadors, then you should leverage the process @Andrea | Ocean Protocol is finalizing. There is a reason why ocean101 and the pledge have been set as requirements. We want the ambassadors to hold to the highest standards in quality and ethics.
- If we are talking about members of a network of ocean stakeholders for India, you can do whatever you want; you may fork anything that we did, it's all open source and shared with the community for that purpose.

I'll dive into the doc later anyways so i can have more precise feedback as well.",,👍 (1),0.6249

- As admittedly it's in a feedback phase at the moment and if there are any red-flags, would be happy to address it before venturing into any promos/activities (that we are deciding in line with a Final hackathon that is planned towards the end of Jan)

- In it's current format. We are trying to get them through the Google form, so the CTA leads them to relevant channels with questions resolved through us. Think of us as more of a guides/helping hands than any sort of gatekeepers/a deciding authority as far as the Main Ambassador WG is concerned. So this would not interfere with @Andrea | Ocean Protocol responsibilities at the moment.

Folks who remain committed to just the Indian outreach would remain on our socials.

- We may have an increase in the number of ambassadors coming from the Indian community and the aim is to have a CTA that bring them here, either 

A) Directly to the WG channel
B) Also get the relatively live support through Our Telegram/Discord channels that we have provided on our Linktree having the Socials 

- In terms of insights, it is still an open sentiment; that I had also gathered from @Gyan | Starknet Foundation/TPG who completed the Academy successfully, who believes in the program and has suggestions to improve it so we can have motivated members as Ambassadors while complying with the pledge. So this was not an insight that was completely based on folks who have not looked to commit to the Ambassadorship, yet. I hope that clarifies.",,,0.9756

Quick update to keep you in the loop! 🚀 

As most of you may have realised from the ambassadors telegram group Q4/2021 saw a lot of planning and strategising. The vision of the Ambassador Program is to build an impactful global team that supports the growth of the Ocean Protocol ecosystem worldwide and, in order to achieve this, the Program needs to be well structured to welcome dozens, if not hundreds, of new ambassadors from each part of the world.
Ambassadors are now working hard to complete their tasks on time. The new program will be ready by end of this month and today we're sharing what will be its core: a brand new **Activity Farming and Rewards System.** 


**Activity Farming**. This is a list of activities that you as an ambassador can pick from and start working on anytime. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r-nG2Vjvicg_a3CUK9FPh2queAOYzhRwNYZyhvOuU4M/edit?usp=sharing
Once you find the activity you like and you are ready to start, add a Trello card with the name of the activity under the “Active” column. 


- **Rewards System**. We have introduced a mix of basic rewards and performance rewards to promote fairness, transparency, and to incentivise high-quality works. 
Base rewards are distributed at the end of each month upon meeting the minimum requirements, whilst Performance Rewards will be distributed upon meeting the predetermined targets at the end of the relevant period. 

NOTE:  If you would like to propose an initiative not present in the Activity Farming list, please add a Trello card in the “Activities Awaiting Confirmation” column and share details such as objectives, rewards request, ETA. Your initiative will then be evaluated by the AP team. 

The Activity Farming list is a living document, it will be reviewed monthly and improved as the program grows. We always welcome suggestions, so please share feedback by adding your comments in the Google Docs.

Happy farming! 🧑‍🌾 ❤️",,"🥳 (6),🤩 (2),🥰 (1),🧜‍♀️ (1)",0.9968

1)    The Gitbook was a great idea, and it looks awesome. The Indian program is delivering on its objectives, which is excellent for everyone in the ecosystem!
2)    Handling ambassador recruitment through the Gitbook makes sense to build a vibrant Indian community, but it is not appropriate to recruit “Ocean Ambassadors” in my opinion. Why do I say that? 
a.    Because the Ocean Ambassadors have nearly completed a revamp of the onboarding process, and once the Ambassador website will be up, the Gitbook will be redundant. I would personally avoid duplicating processes/adding complexity and potential confusion for new ambassadors. 
b.    And because if we use the same process to recruit new members for different groups, we may end up facing unnecessary and unwishful competition across ‘branches’ of the program. 
c.    Finally, it could make sense to consider regional programs as standalone programs, that are not affiliated with the general ambassador group. All would meet and interact in a new Outreach WG, which I understand is in the process of being created. That’d be a great way to federate, share best practices and content, and loosely coordinate across all country programs, including Japan, Turkey, Greece, Nigeria, India, ..etc.",,👍 (1),0.979

1 & 2) Will go through with the feedback with some more considerations. I will also convey them to @Andrea | Ocean Protocol , I had a call earlier today where I expressed that the Ambassador 'program' per se will be an effective add-on with funneling mechanisms & remove duplicity, with more focus on managing traffic henceforth. I will work on your feedback and pass onto Andrea as well so it's in line with the revamped process. 

**But** I see why you mention that they need not be recruited. I will see if the Google form can be sunset with a different mechanism in place, adding redundant process can affect the UX of the general program. Rebranding it slightly different will be helpful in context of Outreach.

c) The outreach WG makes sense, will be a great place to have the processes separate from the Ambassador program in general.

We are feeling extremely happy to see lot of work coming to fruition. In fact, I am proud to finally announce the official revamp of the Ocean Protocol Ambassador Program (OPAP) 🚀 

Q4/2021 and beginning of Q1/2022 has seen a lot of planning, strategising and executing from every single ambassadors. The vision of the Ambassador Program is to build an impactful global team, that supports the growth of the Ocean Protocol ecosystem worldwide and, in order to achieve this, the Program needs to be well structured to welcome dozens, if not hundreds, of new ambassadors from each part of the world. This may, in the future, also involve having regional communities operating under the OPAP umbrella. 

Keeping our vision and needs in mind, the new program restructuring is now complete. I want to thank all Ambassadors and Ocean Core Team for their commitment to the program. Particularly I want to personally thank @LRT, @Robin | DataUnion , @blockchainlugano and @zippy1979 for supporting us in making this possible. 

Today I'm excited to announce:

- A revamped workspace to allow better coordination amongst ambassadors. The workspace is hosted on Notion, a tool that promotes team work and transparency. More details here: https://oceanambassadors.notion.site/Welcome-Aboard-cc9dbe2acbf44908aa7e8aa712a2b9f9

- A revamped onboarding process, where candidates will be guided through the ambassador website (Work in progress: http://oceanambassadors.community) -> Ocean 101 -> and eventually invited to an onboarding video call scheduled each week.

- The introduction of ""Activity Farming"". A smooth and efficient process for each ambassador to actively contribute to preapproved activities supporting OPF, and get rewarded based on two criteria: The deliverable itself & Performance. More details here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r-nG2Vjvicg_a3CUK9FPh2queAOYzhRwNYZyhvOuU4M/edit?usp=sharing

- An experimental reputation system that helps to promote engagement, increased contributions and team working within the OPAP. This system allows ambassadors to earn XP based on their contribution to the program - helping them stand out in our new Ambassador Leaderboard. More details here: https://oceanambassadors.notion.site/Leaderboard-f24b2461b60f4ce1970b255f7dd8767f

- OceanAcropolis. An open space for each ambassador to showcase their work, giving them (and everyone else) visibility across social media channels such as Twitter. More details here: https://oceanambassadors.notion.site/OceanAcropolis-750c110a7a234a7e86f577e7431f573c

- A revised Reward System to promote fairness, transparency, and to incentivise high-quality work. We have introduced a mix of basic rewards and performance rewards. Again, more details here: https://oceanambassadors.notion.site/OCEAN-Rewards-e803515ecda54c1f8fa5200af0343d40

- An open calendar where to find all OPAP meetings. As agreed with @Idiom | Ocean Protocol, all future Ambassadors meetings going forward will be publicly held in the #Ambassadors WG. More details here: https://www.notion.so/oceanambassadors/ff179fec09014037b29ac1bce067080a?v=47d781c17e0e426cafc48623f9398688

- An awesome video for everyone to quickly learn about Ocean Protocol and familiarise with the data economy. Sneak peek coming asap. 

Last but not least, we have also been working on our first AmbassadorDAO. However, this is still work in progress and shan’t reveal more at this time 🤐 

Plenty more is in the pipeline, and we're all looking forward to seeing what 2022 has for us!

This looks like a lot of marketing for me.

I also do not at all understand why a project that a co-founder of Ocean invested in makes it into the Ocean Protocol news stream.
There is no endorsement of Ocean Protocol and Ocean also does not appear anywhere in their whitepaper or technical specs.

Nonetheless this is interesting to see as it is very similar to what we are building with DataUnion, we just have a different approach 🙂

Starting off with a general funda (feel free to critique).  For a p2e concept to work on the current concept, and to interface with a convenient Crypto-network component it has to be with a chain that doesn't disturb the end-user in anyway right?

So essentially that has to function with a network that is conducive for faster txns and lower fee, so from my birds eye view I see that Polygon, Solana are really popular on that front ~ which has happened as a result of marketing of course. Might be a reason why we have so many p2e games from a few suspect chains as a function of marketing/ecosystem push.

- centralisazion of articles into the OPAP medium account (with no audience and exposure yet) 

- publishing articles on ambassadors’ medium account leveraging on their audience/community.

While I prefer the first approach as it can be seen as a more long term strategy, it won’t really bring many benefits to Ocean Protocol in the short term (particularly V4). The second approach doesn’t bring any benefits to OPAP but it does help OPF getting more exposure. 

Hence the question, is there a way you see both solutions coexisting or are they mutually exclusive? Happy to hear other ambassadors too

The funding & work here has already been done and handled by Timothy, however he could use support.

I'd love to see Ambassadors being able to provide technical support, or help find mentors who can help provide support for the event.
I thought I'd put this in here. All the best.",,"👍🏽 (2),🔥 (2),🚀 (3)",0.9761

2) @Mucu did not qualify for the Base nor Performance reward for the physical event as per my notes from the Notion submission. However the event did qualify for the March version of the $200 reward level, so this will be paid. We have however not had any follow on results from these meet ups, 0 Ambassador applications, 0 project onboardings, 0 contributors, so @Mucu , no more events until we can agree on what the value is for the Ambassadors and Ocean Protocol.

At the moment its 30$ Base reward for articles > 500 words and 1000$ Base reward for articles > 1000 words. 

The problem is : The most interesting and relevant articles from OP are mainly above 1500 - 2000 words. But at the moment the work/reward ratio for articles slightly above 1000 words is the best. So the motivation to translate that kind of articles instead of the ones that are much more interesting & relevant is much higher. By raising the reward for this the motivation to translate that articles will rise. 

I suggest adding 3 categories according to the work load: 

> 1500 words = 150 USD Base Rewards + 450 USD Bonus Rewards for 1k Impressions within 3 Month
> 2000 words = 200 USD Base Rewards + 600 USD Bonus Rewards for 1k Impressions within 3 Month
> 2500 words = 250 USD Base Rewards + 750 USD Bonus Rewards for 1k Impressions within 3 Month",,👍 (7),0.9976

I think it's more than appropriate to strip off the last remaining TradBiz / enterprise ties (this is aligned with Trent) and remove the ""Sie"" and replace it with a ""Du"" in our German translations. 

Context for non-German speakers: 
""Sie"" is close to the old English word ""thee"", a (very) polite way of addressing the reader, while ""Du"" is close to the English ""You"".

- With the /Poll Command you can easily create polls. Normal polls have no time limit. A poll can be either a simple yes/no poll or a poll with up to 20 custom answers. When you create a Poll, you can choose who is allowed to vote

- With the /TimePoll Command you can easily create polls with time limit. In this case a poll can run for a maximum of 7 days.

**Useful commands to use: **

allowedrole - to restrict voting to certain roles 
text - to add a long description, perhaps to give context and introduce the reason of the poll
time - to set a time limit to the poll

**Note:**

- You can only create a poll if you're an admin, or have been given the PollCreator role
- To create polls in private channels, go to channel -> permissions -> add role -> EasyPoll",,🔥 (2),0.8625

Dutch is first language ( if you need anything translated, theres only 27 million of us(belgium/holland)  but I could take care of that part/ my french isn't too bad either ( third language) and you'd have to get any translations in french proof read afterward but just so you know thats a possibility. Of all the web3 projects this one has really fired me up as I can see the sound economic logic behind the whole endeavour and its potential, this is just the beginning....other projects up there on my priority list are SingularityNET, Polkadot,  astar, dataunion(just bumped into them recently) and ofcourse Ethereum. Looking forward to helping out and learning, you have a fantastic project in the make and it will only get better.",,"❤️ (3),🚀 (1)",0.9504

For those who recently joined, this monthly one-hour meeting will be an informal conversation aimed at sharing feedback to improve and grow OPAP. Also, as V4 is approaching, we want to make sure we align our work as much as possible with OPF's objectives in order to support them the best way possible. The TownHall will serve for this purpose too. 

You're all invited to join the meeting here on Discord on May 4th, at 4PM UTC - right after the OceanDAO TownHall. It's an open meeting, so the more the merrier 🙂

I also want to be mindful about not spamming our Discord, but I think a Channel with ""Official Links"" would be helpful in the ""Welcome to Ocean"" section. 

I tend to replace ""gm"" with it. It is used, but not as much. And everyone saying gm in the ocean-dao channel instead could even boost collabo. 

So let me ask you guys a favor:

Compile a comprehensive (all essentials there, not too spammy first post) list ""Official Links"" right here (can/should include truly official links like oceanprotocol.com, but also Academy, Ambassadors, etc.).

In short: Going through those 5-10 Links will tell you everything you need to know about Ocean in under 15minutes.

Post the List here, let's elaborate/collect views, and I will create the channel.

We are about to do the disbursements for April deliveries, which when completed, will deplete the treasury. We have submitted a funding proposal for OceanDAO R17. However until new funds are disbursed from the DAO we will not be able to pay the bounties for activities that people may deliver.
**I would ask for your patience and need to request that activities be paused for May until we have confirmation of funding.**
You may ask why we are in this situation, the answer is simple. A combination of the recent market drop affecting the value of the mOCEAN we hold, as well as many of the team overdelivering (and reaching performance targets) in April means that we have needed to pay out more than usual.",,,0.6124

Hello OPAP Friends 

The OceanDAO reconcilliation is now complete and we did not make the funding this round despite attracting more than 1.3m votes. This again means that we will need to pause the Activity Farming until we can resolve the funding issue. I personally will not be drawing any rewards, until this issue is resolved. Everything else needs to be paused (other than Twitter which we need to maintain for visibility and growth). For the activities already submitted we will review them in the month end Activity Farming Review as usual, however how the treasury will be dispersed, will need to be voted on by the members of OPAP. I will ask that when you cast your votes you consider the long term health of the program rather than short term personal gains.

I am in discussions with our advisors how best to handle this situation going forward, applying for funds in every single OceanDAO funding round rather than once per quarter, is not a sustainable funding model for an Ambassadors program. We will need to make changes no matter what.

How we address this and create a sustainable funding model will be worked on and shared with you for comment and then pushed forward. Anyone who wishes to help with this process is welcome to reach out to myself or @blockchainlugano  and your input will be appreciated.",,"❤️ (11),🤝 (8),🙏 (8)",0.9787

**Please read the instructions before jumping in.** There are samples in the document to give you an idea of what the deliverable should be like.

💥  If you have not written before I highly recommend submitting a sample to us before tackling this.

✅ Some of us have already spoken and I am happy for you to go ahead and tackle a blog post. 

📌 Reminder, all blogs will go through a draft review. 

🫂 We are a big team and truly support one another. That being said, there are deadlines and quality standards, and if we feel the blog is not quite publishable, we will likely reassign it to another writer.

🤝 Your notes (we recommend using Google Docs) are important to us as well as OPF so they *must* be posted in Discord

👀  You will contact the funded DAO projects using the provided contact details from the DAO applications; you **must** CC op_ambassadors@protonmail.com in **all** correspondence with subjects.

💗 Let me know if you have any questions! Feel free to post them here for everyone or DM me if you feel more comfortable.",,"❤️ (7),✅ (9),👏 (6)",0.9744

We would appreciate it if you attend them as it's a great way to get answers to questions you may have as well as participate in ideating within community. **Everyone** is welcome to talk.

To clarify writing about the OceanDAO blogs. 

1) OP Ambassador email MUST be cc'd in ALL correspondence with DAO grantee in order to have proof of their responses and verify context and writing within the draft that can then be used for the final product. We have received sparse to no communication nor answers in this delivery chain.

2) The blog post is attributed to the writer or the Ambassadors, this is the writers choice. HOWEVER, seeing as this is a remunerated activity, OPF needs to have first publishing rights to this and I kindly ask Ambassadors'
--- to NOT publish their blog posts BEFORE OPF
--- to wait until the draft has been verified and edited, and is good for publication. 

3) Again, if you have questions as to how this works please reach out to me or @zippy1979 .

📌 If you are an Ocean Ambassador in **2022** and are not actively participating, that does not disqualify you from gaining a membership badge. These are for ALL ambassadors. In this case please DM me your addy so that I may mint a badge for you in the event your address is not on the Notion page of wallets.

🚀 ACTIVE PARTICIPATING ambassadors will receive additional badges, coming very soon!",,"✅ (7),lfg (5),Pepe_Spasm2 (6),🚀 (3),❤️ (3)",0.9196

We would appreciate testing and we welcome feedback! The team includes myself and @okpo.e and @databeatle (who are also Ambassadors :)

• For context you could read the User Story: https://kitblake.substack.com/p/data-streams-like-rain

• Our User Guide is at: https://github.com/chaineresearch/datastreams/wiki/UserGuide

• The UI of our fork is here: https://oceanmarket-datastreams.netlify.app/

• Known issues are in the Github Issue Tracker. You're welcome to open an issue. The code is at: https://github.com/chaineresearch/datastreams/tree/v0.1

**Testing**
Please try to create a new Streaming Data Asset. We used this Helsinki public transportation API as an example stream source:

I understand the concept. The story is interestingly told. Maybe the comic will be interesting? There is a lot of action. One question. Why is the main character's name Volodymyr?  

If you create a text and publish it at a certain time and under certain circumstances. Readers will always have connotations of what is happening around them. I suggest choosing a more neutral name for these times. So that readers can fully focus on your story without context. Contexts create metaphors.",,,0.9034

I see now that giving the main character the same first name as the Ukrainian president may not have been amusing and proved a distraction. So I’ve changed the name. But I haven’t used Alice or Bob. Here’s the thinking.

That Wikipedia article was illuminating. I wasn’t thrilled with Alice or Bob because they have personalities. Now I’ve learned that their personalities were defined in an ""After Dinner Speech"" in 1984. The main character of our User Story doesn’t fit those personalities. He’s a developer type.

Since those early days more characters have been added to the Alice & Bob story. There’s Eve, who’s an eavesdropper, and Mallory, who’s malicious. There’s also “Ivan The Honourable” who was invented in 2002.

'Ivan' is a fitting name for a dev. It connotes the right mindset. Someone who’s honourable and concerned about the quality of the code. The name is also not tied to any specific country. Could even be American, like Alice & Bob are.

Thus the main character in our User Story is now Ivan, and I think it’s a real improvement. Thanks for your feedback, it proved valuable. 🙏",,"👌 (1),👍🏻 (1)",0.9818

I am delighted to announce that the OA Ebook is LIVE on Amazon Kindle (92 pages):
https://www.amazon.com/Ocean-Academy-practical-introduction-Protocol-ebook/dp/B0BHTQ7B1F/

The main content has been extracted from https://www.oceanacademy.io/
The goal was to share this knowledge repository beyond the website!

- Thank you, Jesus Hernandez and John Udoh for the editing efforts
- Thank you @zippy1979  for your guidance through the process.

**Amazon Kindle requires a minimum amount of 0.99$ (mandatory). **
However, I found a trick….

I can run a promotion (for 5 days total) FOR FREE DOWNLOADS!
**It will be active from tomorrow until Monday** 
Do not miss the opportunity!

Finally, feel free to add reviews on the kindle page. 
Your support will be much appreciated.

Thank you for your trust,
Nixon",,"Dank_Rainbow_Frog (4),Pepe_Spasm2 (1)",0.9849

Sometimes great writers are just great, no matter how old the article. Below are some articles I think are relevant by J. DeBruin . 

@Wally in particular talked about interoperability on Wednesday's Ecosystem Lounge meetup. That Ocean was built from day 1 with this in mind, and it's longevity hinging in part to this, which we are seeing.

I recommend meeting up with our community in the Lounge meetups! Have a great weekend fellow ambassadors.

> The battle between Liz Truss and the head of lettuce is intense and evenly matched. The two combatants circle each other, sizing each other up. Liz Truss takes the first swing, but the lettuce dodges nimbly out of the way. The lettuce counters with a strike of its own, using its leaves to whip at Liz Truss's face. Liz Truss ducks and weaves, narrowly avoiding the lettuce's attacks.
> 
>  Despite its seemingly harmless appearance, the head of lettuce proves to be a formidable opponent, using its flexibility and quick movements to gain the upper hand. Liz Truss fights back valiantly, but the lettuce proves to be too much for her.
> 
>  In the end, the head of lettuce emerges victorious, having bested Liz Truss in a fierce and grueling duel. The lettuce stands tall, its leaves rustling in the breeze, as Liz Truss lies defeated on the ground.",,,-0.9064

What are the possible actions that we can take through a DAO on our DataNFTs and datatokens?

I have read about Fractional NFTs in the docs, where a group of people can hold a single NFT and govern actions related to that DataNFT and its datatokens. 
a) how can we implement this? Is there a smart contract (DAO) that is the owner of the minted DataNFT and Datatokens? and the actions that we take on the Data asset (updating, minting datatokens, managing roles) are voted for on the DAO contract and then sanctioned? 
b) Is there any helpfull repo or implementation of a working DAO in the ocean tools as of now?
c) Is this the only use case of implementing a DAO with Ocean Contract? or we can use a DAO elsewhere with Ocean Protocol?",,,0.782

One of our multiple winning DAO grantees has asked for some unpaid/no reward feedback. If you have time to participate it would be appreciated! And if you are building projects or sometimes need to hire teammembers, or are looking to find work, this project you will likely find useful.

Eden protocol (https://www.edenprotocol.xyz/) is getting closer than ever to release the MVP and needs your help to test the product on the final stretch! You'll meet Milo#7738 - product lead, who'll show you a working platfrom, Figma clickables or the brand new idea sketched by hand🤩 your job is to use it and share the feedback - super simple:)

Please book Milo for a quick 30 minute meeting here: https://calendly.com/milo-at-eden/30min",,💪 (7),0.975

The first bounty week has closed and we had very few submissions. I remind all of you that any Twitter  thread, reddit post, medium blogs, etc where you write about Ocean should be shared in the Acropolis. All of your contributions mentioning Ocean are invaluable, and duly so are in the running for bounties. Don't be shy!

Also take a peek at the new updated roadmap and new teams implemented at Ocean, super interesting and a lot to unpack here. https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2023-44ed14510051

End of week reminder & wrap up:

✅ Please have all deliverables for this weeks bounties posted in the Acropolis by tomorrow, Friday, at midnight CET.

🗓️ Please make a note in your schedule to try and make our next OPAP meeting, on Thursday April 06, 17:00 CET in Discord #voice-channel https://discord.gg/b6bCbRgU. (Ambassador voice no longer exists)

The meetup is entitled 'Future Initiatives & Reflections' . What we aim to cover is upcoming use of Snapshot to use as a tool to vote on certain deliverables as the OPAP community, as well as what will be considered worthy of bounty payments outside the scope of what is currently posted. We will also discuss possible future bounties and want to hear your ideas as well.

:Oceancopy: As per next weeks objectives, let's try and maintain the momentum of focusing on OPF official events in Discord with the objective of getting more people curious to onboard to using Ocean.

@Ambassador 
We're co-organizing an AI x Web3 Hacker House event in Lisbon on 9-12 May. If you happen to be around, we'd love for you to join us to hack on some ideas IRL. We've got some great partners that are working on different parts of the decentralized AI stack who will be sponsoring bounties. The house is really nice too (check out some more pics in the attached slides) and there's free accommodation available.

To apply, follow this link: https://partiful.com/e/G2OH6WMmKM98tXp4yRlu.

Team mates. We really need to get a handle on what's being posted in social media comms. 

I am taking an inordinate amount of time 1:1 to ensure you understand how the Ocean tech stack works, what it can and cannot do, etc.

BUT...some posts are simply inaccurate. If you have doubts about your post please ask in our channel before posting. 

Inaccurate data about this technology is worse than no posting. It is simply misleading to the public, and if you put Ambassador in your profile the assumption is you know, on a base level, the workings here.

This is proving to be untrue. Please read and review the massive amount of free writings put out by the OPF team, on Twitter, YouTube, github etc. To deep dive and come back to ask questions if you have them.",,"OPAPShield (14),👍 (6),💙 (1)",0.0772

Really chewed on this which is why today is Wednesday and normally this is done by Monday, but I am remaining shellshocked that 95% of the work put in is simply incorrect or incoherent, some on a large scale. None of you will win bounties this way, so IMO really read and ask questions to understand how this works, or you will be wasting your precious time for zero reward:

Here is an example, see if you can spot an issue, and this is taken from the top 2 threads submitted (good job btw, because it is nearly there!).

Part of a posted thread: 
Ocean Templates is an open-source toolkit from @oceanprotocol that provides a complete answer to common issues experienced in #blockchain dApp development. 

Reasoning this is not of useable quality: 
Ocean Protocol does provide a set of tools and infrastructure to help developers build decentralized applications (dApps) centered around data marketplaces. This includes the usage of templates that *facilitate* standardized data exchange agreements.

However, it's important to note that Ocean Protocol and its tools are specifically tailored to data sharing, buying, and selling use-cases. They may not address all the ""common issues"" experienced in general blockchain dApp development, but they do indeed provide significant benefits for those particular use-cases.

With that in mind, a more accurate statement might be:

Ocean Templates, part of the @oceanprotocol toolkit, provides a comprehensive solution to common challenges experienced in blockchain-based data marketplace development. This thread will inform developers how it can reduce complications and accelerate time-to-market for developing data-centric dApps.

:OPAPShield: We have in the last few months onboarded quite a few ambassadors which is a huge success for us and we have many more coming in. Although our Academy and requisite activities for onboarding are quite thorough, it generally takes time to fully grasp the many technical aspects of Ocean Protocol.

🤝 We are looking to begin fostering greater communication within regions and within our crew, and I highly recommend looking at the Meet the Team page in Notion where you can find fellow ambassadors in your own language or region. This would be a great help as many of you that have been here longer can assist in mentoring newer ambassadors that may have some questions or are seeking clarity.

📣 When it makes sense for the OPAP program, we are happy to support local meetups IF objectives and deliverables are clear. But the first step in this is to find fellow ambassadors and begin discussion, really be clear on the Ocean Protocol ecosystem and technologies,  and then you can reach out to @zippy1979 or @blockchainlugano for advancing this activity.

🧠 Also, don't forget a huge benefit to you ambassadors is each other. Many successful projects have been realized by ambassadors getting together, ideating and building (DeltaDAO, Dataunion, etc). There is a wealth of information between all the brains here, and we would love to see you using OPF's tools in creating amazing products for the decentralized forward thinking web3 space.",,"🫂 (12),ocean (9),OPAPShield (8),dolphin (6),✅ (6),💯 (2)",0.9925

Regarding the new PFP's, those of you that have claimed your ambassador badge will have already seen that yours has been automatically upgraded to the correct one.

We will be pinning a message here to explain the correspondence of badge upgrades to XP points and deliverables. There will also be a message in #🪢︱treasure-hunter covering this.

The new onboarding of ambassadors will now be for participants to have discourse and participation in the treasure-hunter channel, and it is up to US, the ambassadors and OPF core team to reward them with upvoting QUALITY comments, observations, scope of OPF in order to award them points. Each 💯 is worth 3 XP points. Please award these only if the participation warrants it. (gm, emojis, basic comments etc do not count). They will work their way up to 99 points of which then they will be prompted to apply to become an ambassador.

Ambassadors can also upvote one another and this is ONLY a part of you climbing up the ladder, bounties and referrals will be part of it (details will be pinned here in the channel)

The XP bot is to launch very soon, will let you all know when it does.",,👍 (11),0.9747

Please show up and drop a message or emoji so I may assign them to you. 

The XP points works in order to raise your score as you work your way to a higher role. Points are a part of it, bounty deliverables and successful outreach another. Visual cards will be pinned in the channel very soon.

Only Ambassadors and OPF core team may award XP points to anyone in the channel. I ask you to be CAREFUL when awarding them, they are merit based and only valuable, interesting and thought provoking messages should be awarded. 

✅ You can award the member by responding with the 💯 emoji. The rest of the emoji's will not award points so feel free to use those freely.

✅ XP points are awarded in value increments of 3 per emoji.

✅ Ambassador Leads have the capability of removing points, hopefully we should not have to do so often!

✅  You may check your points by calling the XP bot using `/check-xp`

✅ We are a crew and need to work together as such, working towards the same objective. Award those you feel really deserve it, don't be stingy, nor don't award flippantly.

✅ We want this channel to stimulate conversation, learning and action. You may of course use it to your liking, talking about alpha in the data world, web3, the data economy, etc. This is supposed to be fun.

It has taken us a long time to get here, the bot was built for OPAP and we hope this makes our activities fun and a bit competitive and more engaging for you. We will quite soon be running simple and fun bounties in the channel. 

If the bot stops working (as I am not always on) please DM @blockchainlugano  or @zippy1979 to resolve.",,"👍 (19),🔥 (5),😁 (2)",0.9981

From now on I will post these in these requests in the #🪢︱treasure-hunter channel and feel free to ping when completed there, I'd like to keep our channel fairly clean.

We already have a few new interested applicants for the program, so they will be joining the channel and begin their XP journey to get to 99 and be prompted to do a few additional steps in order to onboard. In the meantime please interact and help them discover all things Ocean Protocol. This is the objective, for newbies to understand how Ocean works before they become Ambassadors, and we need your help.

Those of you who assist meaningfully and respond with accurate and complete responses will also be rewarded by the community with XP points. The idea is circular. Let's prompt discussions and deep dives.

New experiment for this month and hopefully going forward. I would like to give a role of #🪢︱treasure-hunter curator to one of you for 1 week. In order to do this, you will be responsible for curating a daily topic to keep high level conversation going in the channel so that our new entrants have meaningful topics to engage in, aiding in their journey to become an Ambassador. 

This need not take up loads of your time, I am looking for thoughtful posts, related to Ocean or at least data,  once per day, 5 x in the week. Also, to follow up here and there on it. In return, you will earn 25 XP points and 25 USD of mOcean at the end of the month. This is something I am looking to rotate constantly to give everyone a chance.

Rep3 badges need to be the same wallet address as your payment address for simplicity and tracking your work.

A few of you put forth some great material. Some notes:

*Be sure what you write is accurate and factual. When in doubt, ask core team in the main channel.

*Be original. A few lines of fresh content go much further than...'Did you know Ocean offers compute-to-data'. This has been tweeted for years.

*TikTok videos. Remember, winners are being added directly into OPF's account, not shared, so it has to be something OPF would themselves make. Think corporate, think funny, think timeless, think global.

My thoughts on it: 

The collaboration with Moonbeam Network signifies Ocean Protocol's expansion to the Polkadot blockchain. Initial integration will empower users to seamlessly ""publish, stake, and buy"" data within Polkadot's ecosystem. Assets from both Ethereum mainnet and Moonbeam will eventually coexist within the Ocean Market, a platform for data discovery and exchange. Enhanced privacy features, network bridging, and liquidity sharing are also on the horizon.

Trent McConaghy, Co-Founder of Ocean Protocol, highlights the alignment of Ocean's multi-blockchain vision with Polkadot's interoperability focus. Moonbeam's Ethereum compatibility makes it a logical starting point for Ocean's Polkadot venture. 

The Moonbeam team is constantly working to simplify the implementation process for Ethereum developers who want to migrate to Polkadot. Ocean Protocol chose Moonbeam as an extension point because of its unrivaled compatibility. The Ocean team can now utilize their existing Ethereum smart contracts to access the new and growing Polkadot ecosystem.",,💯 (3),0.8481

UTU's AI-driven trust infrastructure will assimilate data providers, consumers, datasets, and entities' interactions to construct comprehensive trust profiles. Moreover, Ocean users can rate and review these entities, all contributing to a dynamically analyzed trust signal.

This approach elevates trust and transparency within Ocean Market, minimizing transactional friction. Users can seamlessly access quality datasets from reliable providers, utilize data for analysis or stake, and avoid risks like rug pulls, fostering a more secure and reliable ecosystem

Furthermore, the UTU protocol rewards users for providing precise ratings and reviews while safeguarding their data privacy. Collaborating with Ocean will streamline the process for UTU users to monetize their data on Ocean Market as data providers. Users retain complete authority over shared data, deciding which to monetize and its usage terms.

The partnership aims to facilitate data exchange between their protocols. This entails incorporating publicly-available, on-chain UTU data like endorsements into Ocean Market, procuring relevant Ocean Market datasets for the UTU protocol, and analyzing datasets to generate UTU recommendations and insights.",,💯 (3),0.9839

The collaboration between Ocean Protocol and Moonbeam is important. It helps Ocean Protocol become part of another blockchain. It gives people more ways to work with data. It also allows them to make bets based on that data. All in all, these are new opportunities for Ocean Protocol.
Working with UTU is also a good thing. They are using artificial intelligence to help people trust each other when sharing data. So Ocean Market becomes a place to find safe and quality data. And UTU helps users make money from their data on Ocean Market.",,💯 (6),0.9758

:OPAPShield: As mentioned I would like to have a 'writers guild' meet up weekly hosted by one of you. 
This will be a monthly responsibility and we are happy to support with some tokens and XP's,  I am happy to lead the first two, but I know some of you are wanting to understand why certain bounties 'win' and why others may not have placed.

IMO open discourse on format, topics, quality, etc are important and we would like to see more high quality deliverables! At the moment we are awarding one per category, however if the quality bar goes up, we can support more.

Please DM me if you would like to host these weekly sessions in the voice channel.

Also, what time is best for the first next week?

It's deja-vu. 

Now that our community is growing I would like to test out awarding 2nd and 3rd place Twitter social media bounties, voted on by you, which I always thought to be fair.

So, back to Snapshot team. https://snapshot.org/#/oceanambassadors.eth/proposal/0x60a5eed28f4be3da100c75996a4ffabbc797cfc384efd12ef7fdd0d0ed3714d0

Your rep3 Ambassador badge gives you voting power. It is quadratic so you can spread your vote as you see fit.

Use the guild sheet we have (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14upEOy_slBoiWegN9gsScP2ugMvdN8LcfOxbDYYOIPI/edit?usp=sharing)  to understand which submission is what number. It's pretty clear, yellow column. Voting is open for 4 days since payouts do not go out until Sept. Let's rock this and I will be releasing the next round early next week once the winner is determined.  Again, for the moment this is Twitter only.",,✅ (4),0.969

Regarding bounty round 36 (week before last) we had a major issue, and I was not able to look at them until mid-week this past week. Nearly ALL of the submissions were good  EXCEPT one major issue. Nearly all of you mention 'data is safe with secure data storage' !!! 
This is of course incorrect. Ocean has NOTHING to do with storage and you should all know that, one it was in the quiz to get in and two, by now with all you are reading so much about Ocean that this should be clear. Storage is up to the providor, and Ocean has no access to it, nor can verify what is in the data. 
So no, there were no bounty winners as the few that did have a correct thread were not written strongly enough to publish or they were about data farming which we agreed is not on the subject list.

Moving forward I will again be having 1:1 calls with all potential ambassadors as I once did to assure key factors are understood.  Will be reading this weeks submissions today.",,"🔥 (4),ocean (4),🫂 (1)",0.8971

Know how I keep going  on about how there's a lot to Ocean to deep dive into aside from data markets and compute-to-data?
OPF just dropped Predictoor last week, and well, considering $OCEAN is also classified as an AI token, many of you might be wondering how this all ties together. Models, data predictions, AI....

Reminder on granting XP's in the #🪢︱treasure-hunter channel. Please grant points only for really interesting, high quality or original thoughts, or to new entrants who are making an effort to understand this. 
Repetitive answers or contributions should not be getting awarded multiple times. That in essence kinda games the system. I know it's frustrating and a long road to get XP's, but don't forget even us ambassadors that have been here years started at 100 when this was shipped. 
It's not a race, it's about contribution and quality. We all know Ocean is not a simple protocol, and we put these concepts in place to help people learn. We are working hard on finding novel and actionable ways to earn XP's.

The results are close from the community, which is good because that means you all recognize we have some great talent here! 🍻 
However, upon deeper diving, the winner has been changed to @Feno  for a few reasons, and I am pointing this out for all of your benefit so we don't make the same mistakes.
*the submission should have been for bounty round 38 due to post date on X.
*errors about when testnet, mainnet were online were incorrect in the thread (important bit), but posted correctly across OPF documentation (so double check your work)

The retweet already was fired off by OPF, so OPAP will be tweeting the winner along with the other top 2 during the week. 
Big shout out to @That Blockchain Guy for the emotional ride 🫂  and being the unfortunate subject of this lesson for all. Let's adhere to the dates, and remember, the google doc is more important than rep3, those don't get 'minted' until results come out, so that should be secondary for you all.",,❤️ (2),0.8941

🦖 We are no longer going to hold Ambassador Jam Sessions that was biweekly. Instead we will join up with the biweekly Ecosystem Lounge that takes place on Wednesdays (next one tomorrow). 

🌳 This is beneficial to you all as you can get a better view as to what is happening in the Ocean Ecosystem which gives you additional clarity and context for bounties, building,  and knowledge base. And of course, you are welcome to ask questions.

Just wanted to drop here a little hack for the Twitter Impression campaign starting tomorrow. 

You can try these techniques to farm more impressions 😎

- Add hashtags with high viewerships. #AI could be an example, but there are more. Check the trending section and see if any of them fits. Remember too many hashtags are penalized by X so you want to select them carefully 

- Replies to posts with high views can be another way to farm impressions 

- Tagging other accounts can provide more visibility to your post. Add context to your post such that it makes sense to tag other companies.

- Pin your post to your profile to ensure you gain views every time someone visits your profile

- Sharing your tweet on Reddit or other social media can hugely increase viewrships

- the timing of your post/comment matters

I’d suggest to try them all to see which one works best for you. There may also be other techniques that I didn’t mention yet. 

If you get stuck do let me know! Happy weekend 😄",,🔥 (8),0.9859

Bonus Reward Bounty:  judged by the Ambassador community, please take this survey. We cannot run it in Discord this week as the bot needed for blind submissions is not in our Discord, and the person to add it is unavailable. Apologies for this extra step this week.

Why can’t the winner be chosen in a normal way, by an objective and uninterested person from the team, like you for example?
This vote raises huge doubts:
1. To evaluate the quality of a written text, the examiner must have knowledge and he must read the text carefully and thoughtfully. That is, if a person did not participate in creating the content, then he must first read the material, understand it, and then check works. Who will do this?
2. Where are the guarantees that people who have a voice will even read what is written there? But they won’t give ratings randomly, based on just one picture, for example.
3. In fact, voters are rivals; the right to vote is a tool for various manipulations.
4. Variation with the formation of voting teams.
5. In the ambassador program, people communicate with each other, some closer, some further. It is clear that each person is not objective by default and will give more rating to his friend.

I think we can find more reasons to doubt. I just can’t understand why we need to break something that worked?",,👍 (5),0.8545

We can talk about the nature defi and how it isn't defi, but just a more efficient and digitized form of our current broken economic system. It has all of the financial malfeasance of the real world economy, none of regulations to duct tape the bad parts of it together other than the ones we choose to impose on ourselves, and is essentially is a transparent stock simulator dynamic with all the aspects of a brokerage account based on our 200 yr old current economic system not accounting for the advent of computer systems.

Then most people ask why things die and their money is lost, but its all made up and we can program whatever we want on a DLT provided the opcodes allow it.

Two hiccups. 
The winning bounty on metrics was actually @Qazim if you go by numbers. His tweet looks like it was taken down from being flagged at a certain point and thus was not eligible in the end. There was also a bug on Postmint, now fixed.

The tool spread with google docs led to 2 threads not making in the community vote, as submissions drop automatically from postmint when the threshold is not met. So they were added late, and went unvoted on.

A potential workaround is:
Condense BOTH metrics and quality on Postmint via 1 bounty. Community (those accepted in the campaign, meaning ambassadors) can rate the tweet directly in Postmint. So at that point both are evaluated at the same time, we can weight value to metrics vs rating.

We can as usual payout top 3. This reduces tool spread, and balances those who might play unfair with analytics, and rewards quality in one go.

 @César post was great as well. It was thread that was easy on the eyes and had enough variety in its structure and its actual content to make it enjoyable to read and skim through. Aside from a few repeat words it was great

@KreigDk 🔥 also had a excellent post although images were too busy so it made it harder to consume. Maybe on light mode though. But it was still worded well enough for me to continue reading

It also makes people stupidly petty for twitter posting. @blockchainlugano said it best. You should all build *stuff* so you can get business production experience.  I have developer firms and various affiliated services to help make quality Ocean themed campaigns. I feel like the general usage of the ambassador fund would be better suited for helping you guys and gals make more money and adding extensibliity to Ocean Protocol.

The main focus is to be used in IoT and real world use cases

In this method, one needs to like a post, and in return, they will receive a like. Many websites operate based on this strategy. To participate, you simply sign up and provide your account details. Then, you can select what you want in return: a retweet, a like, or a follow. The website uses a points system. To illustrate, let's say I like or retweet a tweet and gain 100 points. I can then use these 100 points to get what I want, such as followers. If someone follows me, I can choose to give them some of my points, let's say 5 points. So, those who need points can do the same as I did in the beginning to collect points. This is the basic idea of how it works.",,,0.936

News on this Friday.

After a long discussing with OPF yesterday, reviewing our objectives, it has been decided that rules on posting threads in Postmint are little to none.

*one may use any legitimate growth tool available to acquire impressions.
*you may tag whomever you see fit provided it makes some sense (like tagging PEPE doesn't but Fetch, or Elon, etc might.)

We will update the Postmint deets to reflect this.

This task is about metrics and nothing else.

That is why the bonus (quality) bounty pays out 2x the basic, to the best (I know many of you work really hard). We are also going to pay out 4 spaces for basic.",,❤️ (10),0.9319

They are providing moderation services to many different crypto projects and help communities in Discord and Telegram.
For each project they have a catalogue of facts that the moderator can learn from and are collecting answers to difficult questions to make your life as a moderator easier.

The requirements are good English knowledge and experience in Crypto. And I am convinced this is true for many of you here.

We continuously strive to keep our program fair and solid for everyone involved. It is evidenced in our pledge, our small team, our family like environment since the inception of the program.

Using Postmint, a new platform, has allowed us to try and automate certain aspects of our bounty program.

The last round is still not ready to be paid out due to ongoing questions we have with scoring and how to mitigate those attempting to game the system.

As a reminder, we ask that you abide by your signed pledge and participate in the program as an honest person. Doing anything less harms the program, delays payment, derails program enhancement, and just makes the program fail. 

Historically we had very few ambassadors since we value quality over quantity. We still believe this, but have relaxed onboarding a bit compared to 3 years ago in an attempt to get a more group feeling and inclusive not exclusive community. 

I encourage anyone here to use our channel to openly discuss issues you feel need to be addressed. And if you feel more comfortable please DM them to me and I will repost here anon. to stimulate discussion.

I finalized last weeks Postmint rewards. I had to manually adjust for a few things, and scores do not reflect metrics as its impossible to do. So, this is a one off but a lesson here.

*The best performing threads did not win. They should've been kicked out but I left them in the competition, but choosing Ocean's own marketplace is a lazy move. The objective was to think outside the box and either find a ecosystem partner or invent one.

*Due to not being able to score metrics, the points were arbitrarily awarded, in fairness to following instructions, and then best performing.",,❤️ (1),0.8966

I understand if you feel this was a good choice, and perhaps my wording was sharp. However, the point of being an ambassador is to educate the public and promote the tech space outside the obvious.
In fact I did not disqualify the threads, but left them in. Ocean market is not the focus on what Ocean can do, and we need to push traction and build outside of what is an obvious fallback, c2d was publicly shipped via the marketplace, but there are limitless builds that can be done with the tech.",,,0.5106

The predictoor threads , which we have done several times in a row , fall under the same wording . And nothing terrible happened . The question sounded like this : Write about a dApp that uses Ocean's compute-to-data to create insights out of datasets available and add the use of datatokens to sell insights.           Following from the question, you need to write about 1) an application, 2) that uses compute-to-data technology , 3) create insights out of datasets available , 4) add the use of datatokens to sell insights. Under all these conditions, of all the applications, Ocean Market is exclusively suitable , other applications are not fully suitable, since they do not fulfill one or 2 conditions. Some do not create insights out of datasets available, some do not sell at all. At the same time, you put threads about the ephemeral use of technology ( which does not fit the topic at all ) . The above thread is about an application that perfectly matches the topic . I might as well have just written about some Ocean technologies without reading the topic at all , while not getting the risk of disqualification and accusations of laziness . Your criterion - Ocean Market is not interesting for users, since once upon a time there was a lot of information about it on Twitter - is absolutely unfair. I couldn't even know about it in theory. At the same time, Ocean market is a very useful  product that is worth attention. And judging by the number of likes, views and interactions, this thread was very interesting to my audience, it showed the best performance in the entire history of my activities.",,,0.9445

The adjective used was in reference to choice in dapp. That it is Ocean's own seems logical that it would be covered to no end.

I think the wording of the task (Write about a dApp that uses Ocean's compute-to-data to create insights out of datasets available and add the use of datatokens to sell insights) perhaps was not clear enough, my bad, and it should've been creative and hypothetical. For those who could not do so reverting to something else out there that exists would be a logical step. There are many products using Ocean that fall into all the categories, that are using insights via the marketplace or their own. We could go into Dimitra, Datalatte, ones covered by other ambassadors. etc. We are trying to spotlight Ocean tech without being 'Ocean' as they have their own Twitter account and inhouse marketing team that covers what they are doing better than we ever could.

As per the metrics, I agree you had many. And the 3 hour workload to create this goes along with many other ambassadors who spend similar amounts on their thread. But I could not in good faith award the top tweets to ones that cover in essence what compute-to-data is instead of highlighting the workflow outside of the given pipeline.

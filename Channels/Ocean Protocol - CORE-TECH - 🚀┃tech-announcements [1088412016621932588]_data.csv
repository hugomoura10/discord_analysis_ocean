I'm happy to share great news with you all! Our team has been diving deep into the ocean depths of Ocean.js and the Ocean Market, and we are preparing for new releases. 

The upcoming **ocean.js 3.0.0** https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js/releases/tag/v3.0.0-next.3 will come with some ⚠️ breaking changes  and 🎉 exciting features, including a complete refactoring of the library to use ethers.js instead of web3.js, as well as improvements to the jsDocs and the addition of typeDoc. 🐠

On the **Ocean Market** https://market-git-feature-wagmi-oceanprotocol.vercel.app/, we have added support for WalletConnect 2.0 by refactoring wallet interactions to use wagmi and ethers instead of web3Modal, and have updated the code to use the upcoming ocean.js 3.0.0. 🚀

As we approach the finish line of our testing phase, we'd love your help in validating these changes. So it would be great if you’d come dive with us and test them yourself, as your feedback always ranks high with us 🙏🏻 

While we don’t yet have a confirmed date for the release, be sure that we’ll make a splash when it’s ready to launch. So stay tuned for more updates and announcements! ❤️‍🔥 :ocean:",,"🔥 (25),ocean (17),octopus (4),dolphin (4)",0.9896

For clarity, attached is a recording of an AMA the team held last week that describes what & how this means for the token. The AMA  did not introduce any new information. It's all in the blog posts published earlier in the week (links below). And the info there is simply executing on of a policy that we've communicated since the earliest days of Ocean. All of the tokens minted will go to the community, mostly vested over decades.

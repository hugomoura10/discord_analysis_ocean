However the good news is that there will be a much clearer answer in the future.

According to my sources in the team:

The treasury as a discrete object doesn't quite exist yet. Funds are stored in a bunch of different wallets.
The team has begun working on the contracts that will be responsible for this. The contracts have already been deployed and tested on Goerli :Oceancopy:",,❤️ (1),-0.3497

I hope someone can help me understand one thing better: The transactions are paid in OCEAN. With the adaptation the number of transactions increase. As a result, the demand for OCEAN increases and so does the price. However, a higher price of OCEAN has a dampening effect on demand as transactions become more expensive. Therefore, an equilibrium price of OCEAN would be expected, which limits the price potential.

**I'm Daniel from Punch**, a web3 payment provider bridging banks and blockchain. We have been approached by an investment bank that is about to **tokenize a €5B private equity fund** to help protocols diversify their treasury with real-world assets for better risk mitigation. The investment bank needs us to provide a payment solution that works seamlessly between banks and chains.

🤔 **Is this a real problem or just a solution looking for one?**
Before we decide to be part of this, I need to validate these hypotheses:

1. Protocols/Chains/DAOs have the need to diversify their treasury to mitigate risks like asset devaluation.
2. Protocols/Chains/DAOs are interested in diversifying with RWAs such as tokenized private equity funds.

🙏 **I'm searching high and low for experts or those responsible for treasury and strategic investments to help validate this hypothesis.**
Your insights would be invaluable, and I'd be more than happy to share our findings once we've gathered enough data.

❤️ If you can introduce me to the right people or have insights to share, please DM me or reply here.

To give you some context for this group. We realised, through the feedback we received from you(thank you very much 🙏 ) that we we were not doing a great job in supporting the community members that are building with and on top of Ocean. So we decided to pay more attention and allocate more resources specifically to for this.

We see this channel as a platform for you to receive practical assistance with the projects and tasks you are engaged in and also to connect like-minded people that are building with Ocean.

I hope this is the right place to ask, we are building an application with Ocean that depends on Aquarius.

This happen to us in the past, and it was a validation issue on Aquarius side, and we discover that thanks to a person working for Ocean that help us checking the logs, so I suspect this time is similar, is it possibile for you guys to check the Aquarius logs and understand whats going on? 🙏  here’s the relevant data you can use for logs (did:op:37d88d76b41637b7b23e09634c449242b06300d0fbb4663678ac41d486a35906).

Also looks like you created the fixed rate exchange with the parameter 'withMint' `false` or was not set. 
`token"": {
      ""id"": ""0xb37dfb605d7c19927034ebfce20e1eb2ee816c47"",
      ""dispensers"": [],
      ""fixedRateExchanges"": [
        {
          ""id"": ""0x25e1926e3d57ec0651e89c654ab0fa182c6d5cf7-0xd804e318a8ce2eb8d02d845f23caf646a25313311a9c6a2ce1faca71476640fd"",
          ""exchangeId"": ""0xd804e318a8ce2eb8d02d845f23caf646a25313311a9c6a2ce1faca71476640fd"",
          ""withMint"": null,
          ""datatokenBalance"": ""0""
        }
      ]
    }`
Please set this to `true` if want to have to have the asset consumable from ocean market multiple times 😃 .
You can set this in the fixed rate creation params interface https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js/blob/main/src/%40types/FixedPrice.ts#L10.",,,0.9118
